And who are you playing today?
I’m not playing anyone. I   Doderick.
And Doderick is?
Doderick is mild-mannered to a fault. Puppyish in my enthusiasms. Playful, eager and lacking in guile. I am the best friend to all I meet.
Okay. Let’s go, folks!
Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens and Staten From the Battery to the tip of Manhattan Asian, Middle Eastern and Latin, Black, White, New York, you make it happen! Apologies, Fikret.
Yeah? Hey hey hey, man! Good to see you. So. Where are we? Are we ready to fuck or what?
Yeah. Okay. Look. I’m really sorry. But it looks like there’s an issue.
How do you mean, dude? I’m here?
Yeah I’m sorry, but we’ve been looking at the offer, while you were in transit, I mean really looking at it.
What, before you didn’t have your glasses on? You were smelling it? Huh? I got the call.
I’m sorry, but it won’t fly – with my board.
I was told it did?
Yeah well it won’t. Not this actual number.
I came all the way down here, dude?
Well, I’m sorry, ‘dude’.
You know I love what you do. That’s been made clear? I’d love to keep you and your team in place, Lawrence? I love Vaulter.
Sure. I just think bottom line, I can deliver a lot more value for our shareholders. Hope I haven’t inconvenienced you?
I see you. I see this.
We’re grateful for your interest in our little outfit, but I think that’s it.
You got the message? I am not letting you Neanderthals in to rape my company. Ever. You’re a bunch of bloated dinosaurs who didn’t even notice the monkeys swinging by till yesterday. Well fuck you, daddy’s boy.
Oh what? Please.
I’ve got a track record from founding one of the most exciting new- media brands in the world. What have you got? Track marks from shooting junk? Thanks for coming down. Great to meet you. Sorry this isn’t going to work out.
It’s going to work out.
No it isn’t.
What the fuck? Frank. How did this happen? How can we sweeten this?
You still want to pursue it?
Of course I want to pursue. I want to announce. This is part of the whole thing. Our offer is fucking good right?
You want to bump the offer another point? You wanna call your dad?
Do I want to call my dad? No I don’t want to call my dad. Do you want to call your dad?
No.
Does anyone want to call their dad? No one wants to talk to a dad. Good. Okay, so, we’ve started so let’s buy this fucking company? I’m pushing the bid to one-twenty. Okay?
Okay.
How’s it going? Did you close?
I’m right in the middle, Dad. Yes it’s okay! We’re not quite closed. I’m going to one-twenty. So that’s good. And are we still on for the announcement?
Uh-huh.
Great, cos obviously I’m soft floating to like Frank and Rava? And there’s obviously gossip getting soft floated.
By who?
By the ether. I don’t know. Well look, happy birthday, old geezer! It’s exciting. This is going to be great for you, Dad.
I’m excited. Marcy! I thought this whole place was going to be ready? Have they fucked us on the internet because—? My emails— I’m going to call, Ellison or Gates because my emails are— Pencil! Where’s a—?
I think it’s all up, Logan?
I’m not getting anything. Who do they think I am? Uncle Fuck. It’s not working, I’m not paying until—
I think maybe you just didn’t get an email for like ten minutes?
Uh-huh. Okay. He’s started floating. That wasn’t the arrangement. He’s offering one- twenty. He’s got a hard-on. You don’t walk around with a hard-on. Makes you look ridiculous. Get it trapped in the eye of the fucking Halloween pumpkin.
But the me thing? You’re okay on the me thing?
I’m on it, Marcia, don’t worry.
I mean not that I mind?
I do.
This is going to be great for us though. Did you see the brochure I sent? The Galapagos thing?
Oh, yeah? Great. Turtles, all kinds of disgusting shit. Terrific.
A lot more cards? Presidents, prime ministers, royal crests.
Just have Jan log them— so I can see which fuckers have dropped me already. Marcia—
What?
Look I’m not about to spill my guts like some queer. But you know.
Thank you. I love you too.
I’ll be back by Sunday night so I’ll look at his speech with him then, okay?
Okay but his office wants the poll numbers by the prekend.
By the ‘prekend’? What the fuck’s the prekend?
The prekend is Friday.
If he wants them by Friday can he not say Friday?
Thursday lunch to Friday p.m. is the prekend.
Fine. Get Rennie to put them together. Okay?
Ugh. This is a fucking disaster. Shiv? Can you— I need to strategize my gift? What can I give him he’ll  ?
I don’t know, my dad doesn’t really like – things.
He doesn’t like ‘things’?
Not really, no.
Ugh! It needs to say, I respect you, but I’m not awed by you. Start a fresh chapter. What says that?
A pen.
A pen?
Tom, every gift he gets will mean an equal amount of nothing to him. Just make sure it looks like ten to fifteen grand’s worth and you’re good.
Ewwww! He’s puking out of his  !
Fuck  .
Protein spill. Head stays on! Head stays on!
Greg? Are you okay? How’s it going?
Going great.
Uh-huh, so why are you calling me at six-thirty in the morning?
Yeah, great but also – Mom, sorry but I screwed up. Well not me – but look, a, a – kid smoked a joint in my car.
‘A kid’?
Uh-huh?
And so, if you can believe it, the car smelt like skunk weed, and I guess I smelt like – well you can see from there, how I got implicated in this kind of tragic misunderstanding?
Did you – tell them – who you are?
No. No. I thought – no. I didn’t want to be an asshole. Or – get into it all. I don’t know. I liked it. I’m sorry, Mom, I’m such a fucking screw-up!
Okay. Listen to me, here’s what you’re going to do—
Okay. Uh-huh.
What? What do they say to one-twenty?
They’re not going to budge unless it gets to be a stupid number.
What’s a stupid number?
What’s a stupid number? A badillion? I don’t know.
Because one-twenty is stupid.
Look, I think this is clearly about Lawrence. Should we look at his package?
Okay. Who’s this? Is this news?
Hi, Kendall Roy?
Hello?
I was sent by – Roman. To burn some sage?
Excuse me?
It’s auspicious? I’m a business alchemist. It’s a gift, from your brother.
Will it set off the smoke alarms?
Not usually.
‘Not  ’?
Yeah, we’re looking at a billion-dollar acquisition so I think we’ll need a little more reassurance before we break it up with a building evacuation?
Hey hey hey, motherfuckers!
Roman.
My guy? Are you saging?
We’re just concerned about the alarm?
Right, bad juju. Maybe you should make a move, dude?
I can use essential oils?
I think just fuck off thanks. How’s it going?
Good. Just finessing. You okay, man?
Of course I’m okay. Obviously I’m okay. Why do you ask? What here? Oh, man, I’m so over all this. I was a bad fit. I was never a corporate cock-suck anyway. Besides. I never got this high in the fucking building! They stuck me in LA with Old Father Time, we were the pool boys, right, Frank. Fucking banana cabana? So. What’s the bid?
Well—
What that’s ‘commercially sensitive’ – I’m still on the board, bro!
Going one-twenty-five.
One-twenty-five! Fuck!?
What? High or low?
Whatever! For Vaulter? Bit of content and a brand name? Your funeral. You’ll be captain soon enough. Oh c’mon, every intern on the Street knows you’re stepping up. Congrats, man, congrats. So pleased to be out. The company was essentially a cage to me. Well, congrats. I ought to head. Look at all this fucking bullshit!
Marcy, I’m heading out, as ordered.
Great, till one should be—
Fine – but just here – yeah? I don’t want to get a fucking heart attack from the surprise. Have them here. And not too loud. Just – a—
You want me to email you the exact details of the surprise?
Dad?
How’s it going?
Fine. Good. Why are you—? Are we okay?
Oh yeah. Yeah. I just have some paperwork—
Ahead of the announcement?
For putting Marcy on the trust. Just bullshit. But I felt like checking in.
Oh. Because on my announcement, what’s the precise timing on that?
Let’s see how this goes and I can lay it out.
Okay? So this is just the trust? It doesn’t affect me stepping up?
Nuh. I think I told you about—
Dad – I’m busy, do I need to lawyer all this?
It’s housekeeping.
Fine. Marcy’s fine by me. I mean the others, might not feel the same?
I’ll deal with that. Okay. So – I’ll see you in—?
Yeah look, Dad, on lunch. I really want to be with you but the deal—
If you need to stay, you need to stay.
I really want to be with you?
I appreciate it.
It’s just, delicate. I mean they can handle it but—
. Any indication. Call me. Okay? And look, this is gonna get press-released, but – by tonight I’m going to be Chief Exec of Waystar. . I just wanted you lowlifes to be amongst the first to know, okay?
Congratulations.
Thank you. Okay. That leaks, you’re all fucking fired! Off we go let the trumpets blow Because the driver of the mission is a pro. The ruler’s back!
Okay, guys – can we back off, private event? Freelance? Could be getting colder out there, boys. Mr Roy. Logan, you going today? Is that right?
Fuck off.
Hi. Hello there!
Can I help you, sir?
I’m actually – I’m here to see you!
Can I see some ID?
I’m Greg? Marianne’s Greg? Your nephew? My mom called Marcia and I heard – I checked with the – the man and he called up and said it was all okay—
Oh. Right. I didn’t know you were coming?
Yeah I’m— I think you did?

I’m on my own. I hope it’s okay. I wanted to say, many happy returns.
Thank you. You okay?
Oh fine! Seriously, fine. I get it. I could have been anyone. An assassin. You could be dead now, or dying. But – yeah. Happy birthday!
Hey, Global Tom! How you shaking? You still fucking shit up for us?
Ha! Still tidying up your mess, pal!
Sis. The pols still boring the living shit out of you?
Yeah, you know, still burying the bodies and counting the cash.
Ha! Look at you. Walking around like you’re an actual human person!
You smell good. What is that? Date Rape by Calvin Klein?
Yeah you wish!
‘You wish’?
Okay! He’s back! Folks, he’s back! Can we – can you find somewhere?
It’s – a long way up.
Ah?
It’s— We’re going up?
Uh-huh.
So great to be here. I thought you would have known. I hope it’s okay?
Sure. Good to see you.
I actually came because, I needed to ask something?
Uh?
Yeah um, I actually I think you know but I had some help, and I got on to the international management-training program? The theme- park tour? And – and – I was very into it? But I got sick. Out of – actually – out of Doderick’s eyeholes and—
Great. Excellent. Wonderful. Okay, give me some room? Connor, Primo! How are you?
Good. Excellent, Pa. Here you go.
Roman, Romulus! Look at you, you look fantastic!
Happy birthday, Dad.
Siobhan. Sweetheart. Is Tom here?
Uh-huh. Yup.
Oh well, never mind. This is Craig, everyone, by the way. Cousin Craig.
‘Craig’? It’s Greg. No?
Yeah. Greg. Greg. People have mistakenly called me Craig in the past so I answer to both.
Here. It’s just a token of my very real and enduring admiration and the hope that a new dawn might—
Kendall? You came.
Hey. Big day. Congratulations. You bastard.
Congratulations. Good luck.
So, what’s the news?
Okay. I’m just gonna—?
Okay, we’re good. Talk to me— Is there word? You’re on speakerphone.
PPG Bank have got their nose in, might be rustling up another bid.
Ugh. Shit on my dick.
O-kay! Now the fucking’s started!   you’re getting fucked!
I’ll call you back. Just a few final issues with the acquisition.
PPG are balls deep in him. Hustling up a rival bid.
Okay!?
It’s under control.
You know, I think the only thing worse for us than buying that piece of shit would be trying and losing.
Fuck off.
Well that’s unnecessary!
You want the rival bid to go away? Banks are whores. Pay them and they’ll fuck anything. So cut them in on our financing and—
Well, no because, there are rules—
Yeah the rules are for the – the people who like rules—
Are you getting played, Ken?
Am I getting played? No I’m not getting played. I’m the puppet master. I’m all over this, like fucking – mayo. Now look, can we please clear the room please? Thank you. I’ll be out, yeah? Thanks, guys. Great input.
People need to know you’re the boss, Ken?
Uh-huh. I know it.
This is your day. And not because he said eighty was retirement in some interview ten years ago. Because you deserve it. You did the MBA, you did the hard yards. China. But you might just need to push it over the finish line?
I’m not losing this deal. We call PPG, offer to cut them in on the financing, if they make the other bid fuck off. Okay? It’s Logan’s idea.
Great idea, Ken. Right idea.
Thank you. You are able to do anything. You are a master of the seas. If your final destination has been correctly determined, then all apparent diversions are but waymarkers of your route.
So, I brought you this. Happy birthday.
Oh. Thank you. This is? These are nice. These are nice houses – where is that?
That’s Vancouver?
I like Vancouver.
That’s our old house, Dad. These are all our old houses? LA, yeah? Montreal. London?
Wow. The paper is very thick.
Yeah. You like it?
Oh sure. Great. This is— a quality item. I want to look at this properly later. So, go on, give me five. What’s the news. What’s happening?
Good. Yeah. I want to talk to you about Tom. He thinks maybe he might be ready for the parks, you know globally and—
Look, Dad, we should get this somewhere ambient. You want to—?
Connor. How you going? How’s the ranch?
Perfect. Light pollution is like zero so, that’s nice, you know.
Wonderful. What the hell is it?
It’s a – goo? Is it goo?
Perfect.
Sourdough starter.
.
I thought you might enjoy making something?
Uh-huh? Right?
Fine. Forget it. I just thought you might like it?
I do. I just don’t know what the fuck it is.
It’s sourdough starter. To make bread, without yeast? The old way?
Oh, okay. Old bread. Thank you. How are we looking?
I’ll keep you posted. Look, Dad, I just checked with Frank and the holidays mean the board might be hard to get together and it’s all over the web, so I’ve scheduled a call for four? Then we can issue the release?
Uh-huh. You did?
Yeah. Is that okay?
You go on. I’m not going.
Sorry we’re late.
No worries. You’re not even. Twenty is margin of error.
And I got your message. That’s fine.
Yeah? It’s just as it all goes through – next two weekends will be crazy. But then – once it’s done, it would be great if—
It’s fine. Bank the weekends – spend them later.
I don’t want to fuck things up though. I can come up to you? And then – if you want we could grab dinner for the handover?
What like – two weekends. Ummm?
No? . Are you seeing someone?
Yeah. I am. And I’m just hoping this one won’t leave coke smeared all over the kids’ iPads?
Uh-huh. No. Fine. Yeah.
Kendall, it’s okay. I’m fucking around. You’re good. Coronation day. You deserve it. Seriously. After everything. And I think you’re going to be able to cope with this.
Well, obviously I’m going to be able to cope with this.
Exactly. I know.
Are we okay? Lunch in ten.
Hey, okay, listen, just two minutes before lunch? Kids. Can I get you, for two minutes?
Oooh a speech!
Er Uncle Logan could I get—?
Not now.
Sorry. I need your attention. About the— What I was saying, about the management-training program? I need to get back in.
You’re out?
Yeah. I got, there was an issue – and so my grandfather said to come and talk and—
I’ll do anything for my brother.
Oh that’s – that’s nice and, I’m really going to give this one hundred percent and I would love to be able to move up and—
He just needs to ask.
Oh. My grandfather? Right? I think he doesn’t like to— I mean you two don’t, talk so much, right?
Anything. Just get him to ask me.
Uh-huh. Hm. Right.
He wants some sourdough tips!
Hey. It was just an idea. What did you get him anyway?
Money.
Dude, he’s gonna love it. He can let it rise while he does his yoga?
Dad – are we—?
What’s the deal?
Er – yeah. So. . On the family trust, that will decide the situation in the event of my unlikely demise. I’m going to add Marcia to myself and you four.
Whoa? Okay?
With my seat also to go to her on my death—
What, which would give her, double voting weight?
Uh-huh. So I’ve got the paperwork for—
What so, Marcia will have two votes when you—?
 he—
Well no, Rome, it’s not an if?

Well it doesn’t matter what we want in this case, Rome?
Kendall’s already signed up but if I can get you all to—
Two? Two votes. I don’t think I was aware of that when I—
Read the small print, asshole!
This looks— I mean, yeah. But, I might need to talk to— You know, for all the implications?
Of course.
Just to get the full picture?
Sure. Take a beat. But look, I love the bread – goo and the picture book, but this is the present I really want? So by four, good? And also, I just mentioned this to Kendall, but despite the chatter, and all things considered I’m going to give it a couple of years.
As in?
I’ll stay in situ. As Chairman, CEO and head of the firm.
Dad, you what?
Well I just said, son, or were you not listening as usual?
But – I’m, you’re not—  ??
No big deal. I’m just staying on. We can discuss the details.
You   tell me.
We can announce you’re in pole position. Pending events. A move up or some—
‘Pending events’?
Okay, lunch! C’mon.
Dad?
Oh fuck!!
Well I don’t know what you’re fucking laughing about!
I’m not even laughing – what?
What the fuck? This is – this is going to be a shitstorm. He’s going to blow the firm’s credibility. Did he look okay by you?
Oh come on! Ken. This is typical.
I’m out – okay, I’m not playing. Whatever you three say – goes. Goodbye!
Con!
On the trust, I refuse to play. I don’t want to engage. I’m water, I just flow.
This doesn’t stand, right? Oh fucking  , you’re fucking   me …  ? Are you messaging? What are you …
Hey! What the fuck? Off the cloth, moth! Private! We’re not fourteen, dude!
What are you—? Are you telling? This stays in here. This is a lockdown—
We all need advice, man—
Advice – what? You’re gonna give a double vote to a power-hungry maniac who will do   with it because she’s got our dad’s dick in some super-max pussy grip and she’s juicing him before he croaks—!
Oh, dude, come on—
Um, guys? Lunch is coming up—
Sure thing.
Sorry, guys, I know you don’t get to see each other much but we’re nearly—?
No fine, thanks, apologies—
Not at all. It’s do as you please here. It’s not like we’re in a maximum-security penitentiary.
Hey. So you’ve fucked me?
I changed my mind, Kendall—
When? When  ? Cos it feels like you fucked me.
I had doubts and then certain things caused me to rethink.
When? Like what? This is—
It’s me. It’s mainly me. But you – you’re still— Three years ago you were still in the nuthouse.

It’s all good. I’m just worried – you might be soft, as yet.
Are you kidding? I’m battle-hardened. Fucking year in Shanghai.
I hear the guy from the website trash-talked you and you let him just come?
Not a website. And I was being professional!
I hear it played weak. Conflict-averse.
I wasn’t about to get into a fucking big-dick competition.
I hear you bent for him.
What?
I hear you bent for him and he fucked you?
Well, no.
Thing is, you’ve probably read a lot of books about management technique and this and that but you know what?
What?
Sometimes it is a big-dick competition.
That’s it is it? I should have shouted at some guy? But I didn’t? So you’ve ripped up eighteen months of corporate strategy?
And you never lawyered the trust change.
Oh, I   my father. That’s a black mark?
It’s an – an accumulation. You left the room. The deal.
To come to my dad’s fucking birthday party? We don’t know how many more there’ll be! So come on. When will you be ready? To step down?
I don’t know – five?
Five  ?!
Ten?
Ten!! Dad? Seriously?
It’s my fucking company.
Yeah and you’re running it into the ground. You spend all your time on costs – where’s the vision? You’re off the beat. Where’s the growth? All our graphs go down. All of them.
That’s why you’re paying a billion dollars for a gay little website?
It is   a fucking  ! It’s a portfolio of online brands and digital video content and it’s part of a strategy to save us if you’ll just let me —
Do you want to hit me, is that it?
For fuck’s sake.
Are you going to cry?
You know I’ve been floated already? There’s fucking paps outside. I’m getting asked for quotes?
Fuck them.
Yeah, course, ‘fuck them’. Great media strategy, Dad, great business strategy. When the Street hears, when the board hears?   sold a very promising digital platform for buttons. You just fucking missed it, okay? Fine. Everyone misses things. But you gotta let me get our beak in. The world is—
Yeah yeah. Everything changes. The studio was gonna tank when I bought it, everyone was gonna stay home with videotapes, then guess what – no, they wanna go out. Everyone told me no one wanted to watch network, except you make it zing and they do. You make your own reality. But once you’ve done it, then, apparently, everyone’s of the opinion, it was all fucking obvious? Lunch!!
Um, that was delicious.
Thank you.
Not at all.
No, absolutely fantastic. The whole day. So thoughtful.
Suck-up. ‘Gee you’re so great, Double-Vote-Power Mom!’
Fuck you.
And Greg, how’s your mom?
Oh good. I mean she can play the – the – nut-crusher, but she’s  great.
Oh that’s good. That is good.
Okay. Thank you very much. Now, when we’re done. It’s time for the game.
We’re playing the game?
Well, it’s my birthday so yes we’re playing the game!
You okay, Greg?
Sure – I’m not …
Wanna jump in with Frank or Connor?
Um. I think— Is there room in there?
I’m sorry if it’s a crush?
S’fine.
Yeah, I was just talking. To your brother? Grandpa.
Uh-huh.
He said, ‘Happy birthday’.
Did he?
Well. No. I guess. Not. But he is aware it’s your birthday.
Uh-huh.
But it occurred to me. Talking to him, and Mom, that having him with his seat on the – on the holding company, still, from historically. That must be suboptimal, in some ways? But if I could – if he was willing to give his seat, eventually, to someone more – perspicacious. Who could learn the ropes, running say a theme park. Would that, maybe, be a win-win?
Running parks?
Just learning. Just a little guy. Initially. Could that be—? You scratch my back … I wouldn’t say I could scratch yours. It’s too considerable. But – you scratch my back, I you know, not suck your— But. Is there an angle there perhaps?
 … I don’t like Lefty.
Which?
Lefty.
Lefty? Yeah? He’s – he’s a trusted— You’ve had him before?
I don’t want him flying me.
Uh-huh?
He’s safe, I’m sure. But we had that bumpy touchdown on the Vineyard? He looks like a prick.
Not a problem – do you want me to – let him go?
He’s fine. Just—
You go Righty. Who shall I send in Lefty?
I don’t— Greg or Connor and—? It’s fine. You decide. did
Can we go? What’s going on, Colin?
Just jump into that bird, Shiv, thank you!
So what you thinking, son? . On the thing? She’s really smart. She’d make good picks. Family first.
Oh sure. I’m sure.
So?
So? Well, you know. I guess, I want to do anything for you. . But—
But, where’s your cut?
No. God no. It’s your firm, Dad. It’s not ‘what’s in it for me’. But you know, what   in it for me?
I would love to get you back in?
Sure. Sure. It was just tough last time.   tough, with Frank over me, in LA.
Frank is important to the firm.
Oh sure. I understand. It’s just, at the studio I had ideas, I’m quite an innovative thinker, but I found a certain amount of resistance?
Is this still the film thing?
No, what?  ? It’s not about one great idea. It was a culture. I think he was maybe threatened by my energy?
So what would be your dream outfit?
Oh, I don’t know. You know me, I think we should liquidate. Financialize. Who wants pipes and product. When you can float hot with pure cash?
Uh-huh.
But if not. I’d wanna run the show. But, till that opened up. Chief Operating Officer. But I guess, that’s Frank?
Uh-huh.  
How you feeling. We good?
Yep, sure. I’m not totally against Marcia as a concept. And you know Tom would love to oversee the parks? He’d be good?
He would? Okay … And for you. If things are getting shaken up, would you come inside?
Dad, I’m not just playing with the politics.
No sure. Politics. Politics. Shiv, not to be crude, sweetheart, but politics is what comes out the asshole. Wouldn’t you like to be up front, feeding the horse?
My guy, he’s got that Airforce One look.  So to come back, I’d want the top job.
And if that was difficult? Overseeing everything outside the US – parks and all?
What, me Tom’s boss?
Yeah? Stepping stones.
What’s the long-lost cousin sniffing around for?
Oh he screwed up. Needs help.
Are you gonna sprinkle some sugar in his bowl?
I like him.
You like him?
Kind of. He’s scratchy. Hungry. I think he might fit at the parks eventually? Could Tom handle competition?
Yeah so – just wanted to give this to you. And say ‘happy birthday’.
Thanks.
Yeah it’s just a Patek Philippe. So. It’s incredibly accurate. Every time you look at it, it tells you exactly how rich you are.
That’s everything I look at, Tom.
My lawyer says it needs to be simple majority.
Same. So what are you thinking?
Well – starting position is – I’m diluting my power and that’s, probably a no, right?
Absolutely. My thing would be, why would we do this? Shiv’s saying she’s for no, on Marcia?
Well – no, I said— That’s my   position.
Oh, I thought—
It depends.
Uh-huh, it   depend.
How does it depend?
What the final situation is?
Plus, do you want to tell Dad no?
That’s not a big deal.
Yeah?? You’ll stick the bottle brush up the Lion King’s butthole?
As a group, we could just— Sure. I’d cram that shit right up.
He’ll put a kebab skewer through your eyeball.
Look my thing is – maybe it’s a package. Here’s the deal: we say no – all of us on the trust, full block. We say: stability. Stick to the plan. I take over – and we just – you two, under me – co-presidents?
Under you?
Uh-huh. But three. The power of three?
Interesting.
Can we think about it?
Of course—
Yeah I thought about it, fuck you!
So I hear you’re the new kid?
Oh well I only just started to get into the business I’m not even—
I’ve got my eye on you. You need any help, advice— just, you know— . don’t fucking bother okay? Are you tripping?
Right? As in?
I’m only razzing you, cuz! You’re dreaming! Relax. Pals, yeah? Would you kiss me, if I asked you? If I told you to?
Kiss you? I don’t …
Your face! Haha! Fuck me, man. That was an expression. Pals!
Oh – okay. Apologies. Hold it. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay. Okay. I’m out of here. It’s the crunch. Frank, will you be linkman here? Dad, can I—
Of course. Everything okay?
If Kendall’s going we need one more to make it fair!  You wanna?
Sure?
C’mon. You’re up. Relax. Can you hit a ball? Cos I’ll give you a million dollars if you hit a home run, kid. I don’t know why you’re smiling. Seriously. A million.
Hey, I’ll do it for a million! I’m kidding – you’re good.
Grace, where’s my—
Rome?
Oh you don’t want him incentivized! One million dollars for a home run.
Okay. We okay?  – 
Ah, man. You choked! You choked it! Still you tried. Here’s quarter of a million!
Yeah – hey it’s just background for the story I heard you had cooking? Yeah I know Kendall Roy. And he’s saying Logan’s lost it. Kendall loves him but he’s slowing down. Making bad calls. Some major shareholders are worried. That’s what I’m hearing from people close to the family— those disloyal fucks.
Hey. Lawrence. Sorry the other offer evaporated. But we fattened the goose nice now, right?
I hear it’s a decent package.
The number is one-forty. Cash with a stock alternative. You’re on our board. Take the stock and you’ll own a nice piece of us. Rockstar salary.
Well that is an appealing package.
It is, yeah. It’s appealing.
You better play nice though. Because I’m the whole company.
No. You’re OFM. One Fungible Motherfucker. You think you’re so fucking hip but all I want is the brand. The whole firm is just so much fairy dust. It just happens I want some today.
Well we’ll see if I choose to—
Yeah I think you’re going to stick around. I’m going to stuff your mouth with so much gold. Non-disclosure agreement. Non-compete. I’m going to lock you in a golden cage, fuck you with a silver dildo and pay you so much you sing whatever song I want.
Easy. You still need me to recommend this or—
No, this is a deal so fucking good you have to take it, or we’ll see you in court.
You wanted five?
Yeah. Frank. I’ve been thinking if now isn’t a time for a new role for you?
Okay? As in. What sort of—?
Light duties.
‘Light duties’? Are you kidding? Logan. Me?
No one has as much respect as me for you, Frank—
Oh no. No, c’mon, fuck this—
It’s a step up. The press release should be on your phone. Just proof it. You might want to add some color, it’s quite dry.
That’s it? To  Here? You are what you do, Logan. You know that? In the end you’re just what you do.
Yeah well, you’ll get your nut. Hey, kids?
So. What you say, kids?
What’s the Frank situation?
Frank’s out of the picture.
Yeah? Fuck.
Frank’s dead. Tom should be stepping up. Shiv’s thinking about a new role. So, are we good?
Um? Shiv?
Rome?
Um? Con?
I’m with these two. What they say goes.
Our position is that this doesn’t quite work for us. At present.
You what?
It’s not sufficiently attractive. As a proposition.
Are you fucking joking?
We get that. We do. We’d like to help. I’d love to help.
Then help.
But – why would I? When— I mean— Giving   power. Why would I do that? —
Dad? It’s just a first position?
Dad? Dad.
Dad!
Dad?
Take us— Get us to a hospital.
Dad? Are you—?
What’s Dad—? Are you—?
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Thank you. Kendall? You heard?
What?
Deal. It’s very exciting. I can’t wait to join your board.
I think you’ve made a great decision and I hope there’s no hard feelings over all the cock-jousting.
Nuh-huh. You win.
 yes!
Your dad just had a brain hemorrhage.
What?
I’m sorry. I’m sorry for you.
Are you? Is this—?
But you just invited me into your chicken coop. And I’m going to eat you all. One by fucking one.
Hello?
We’ve got an eighty-year-old male, found with LOC. Vitals are BP one-ninety over one-oh-two, pulse at ninety-four. Respiration at twelve. Patient only responsive to pain is on high-con O2 at fifteen- LPM. He’s unstable. I’ve spoken to the daughter, she can’t tell me what meds he’s on.
Why aren’t we moving? Why the fuck aren’t we moving?
We’re in traffic. We’ll get there.
Still unresponsive. Take eight vials and get them to the lab.
How long, how long does the satnav say? Which app is that? Cross-check, cross-check Waze and Google Maps and Apple Maps. I don’t care about the traffic! Make it. Let’s make it. Let’s weave, man. This is my father. Middle lane! My father’s dying, let’s get me there, let’s do it. Roman? What? Is he okay? Stop crying, buddy. Please. I can’t understand anything you’re saying, man. Seriously. You’re going to make me cry. I’m there, I’m nearly there. I’ll be there now, man, okay? Hang tight. I love you. Tell Dad I love him. Okay? Oh fuck. Oh fuck. We need – we need. I don’t know what we need.
Ken, we’ll be there. We’ll get there. You can’t park there.
Talk to him. My dad might be dying!
Hey. Are you okay? Do we know anything? Are you okay?
Yeah. No. Yeah.
What can I do to make this better? Tea? Call your mom?
No.
Shiv, I’m human Siri, task me.
Um, tell Sarah to get Dad’s doctor. And research the best neurologists.
I will action that.
Maybe I should? I should go through my diary with her, clear it out, and you won’t know what’s important …
Hey. I’m doing it. I’ve done it. It’s already happened. Forget it.
Sorry, you need to be in the waiting area.
What were you and Marcia saying?
What?
You were just – you were looking at me and talking?
She said, ‘You’re my favorite, don’t tell Shiv.’ What do you think? She asked what happened. So I told her.
It will be okay, I promise. I’m here.
Thanks, big man. Huge relief.
Hey come on? Just saying, lean on me.
Hey. Where are we at? How is he?
I’m sorry, we need this area clear.
I just arrived? I don’t know where to stand, okay? Show me where to stand and I’ll stand there.
Wise elders, Ken. These people do an incredible job.
Fuck. What’s the situation? Do we need to call anyone? What is this – part of the hospital, is this the best – section?
Excuse me, are we in the best part of the hospital? Sorry – but we need to—
The ICU is the ICU. This is the best place for him.
I told the staff to take Rava and Grace and the kids away, and bring them in later, yes?
Should the kids see this?
It’s good. It’s the cycle of life.
Well he’s not dying.
Nobody said he was dying.
He did.
I’m sorry, could you give the team some space?
Here’s an idea. How about you worry about the medicine, not the fucking feng shui?
Can you give us a picture please, and we want to just check this is the highest care level available? Look. Do they know who we are? Do they know who he is?
Should we call Mom?
No. What? There’s a million people to call. And she’ll make it about her.
I think you should call. I mean, it’s not like she’ll come. Will she?
Folks. You need to wait through there—
Hey, I’m sorry, we’re getting mixed messages. We have no clue what’s going on.
We’ll be with you as soon as we have an assessment.","[set(), set(), {'Logan'}, {'Logan'}, set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), {'Logan'}, {'Waystar'}, set(), set(), set(), set(), set(),

2,"We need to know what’s happening. There are hundreds of thousands of American jobs dependent on his wellbeing.
‘Hundred of thousands of …’
Hey, I’ll say anything to get him the good medicine.
So, look, what happened, exactly?
I don’t know. It was freaky.
We were just talking.
Yep, one second Shiv was hardballing Dad, the next he mumbled something and – you know.
I wasn’t hardballing him, we were talking. A brain hemorrhage doesn’t come from some chit-chat?
It’s definitely a brain hemorrhage? Is that what they said?
Someone said brain hemorrhage? Right?
Did they? Or stroke?
Umm, the first – the ambulance guy?
A stroke is a hemorrhage.
Did someone say hemorrhage or is it just you who said it?
It could be an aneurysm?
Why aren’t we chasing this?
Is there any—? Did Dad ever talk to you guys about cryogenics?
Are you insane?
I’ll chase.
We need to call Dad’s doctor. And his neurologist. We need to be on this, now!
We already called Doctor Judith. We dropped that we know half the board. Kendall, I’m on it. We are checking out names. We all are trying to do the best. Back the fuck off.
According to this it sounds like a stroke. Could be an acute subdural hematoma.
Great, get in there and operate, Doctor Google.
He once talked to me about cryogenics. What, wouldn’t that be typical, all the other billionaires are strolling around with new bodies but not Dad because we were too embarrassed to actually discuss it?
Let’s just worry about keeping him alive till tomorrow, before we worry about the next thousand years, yeah?
I know. And on his birthday too. It’s so shitty.
What’s happening now? Are you staying at the hospital?
I guess. I think I’ve got a job, but I don’t know. Logan said I did. But Marcia was the only one there. And then he tragically, you know. Should I ask her?
What sort of job? A good job? A blowjob?
I don’t know. I can’t believe he offered me a job and then he had a brain hemorrhage, it’s so unfair … Unfair for him, I mean. And everyone. I have like twenty bucks. The world is so fucked up.
I am not sending you any more money, Greg. Step up. Harvest an organ. And make sure. About the job. Because that side of the family, they’ll spit in your face and charge you for moisturizer.
I know. I know it. They are.
Just don’t do or say anything stupid. I need to call your grandpa and let him know—
Do you have cash?
Er. No. Not— Just—
Thanks.
ATN obituary. They want us to okay it in case they have to run it?
Is it nice?
Made by his own news outfit? It doesn’t say he was a prick. You
Well I’d love to see you. Yes, it’s appropriate. It could hardly be more appropriate.
There’s nothing in here about Mom, or Connor’s mom. They need to be included.
PJ says Aziz Khan at the Mayo Clinic is the best there is.
I know a great hypnotherapist.
Uh-huh, interesting. You think this is a good time to get him to stop biting his nails?
I meant for  . For recovery. Roman.
Sarah says Ann Wieman at NYU.
That’s not the name I have.
Well it’s the name I have. Tell her to call them. —

Hi, I’m Doctor Lewis, the senior neurologist here— So. We’ve done everything we can to stabilize Mr Roy—
And is he okay?
He’s fine. It’s a fucking power-nap. Medical siesta.
I’m sorry, I can’t tell you more until we know the results of the CT scan, but we’ll have those soon.
Doctor, look, ranked, what are the most likely outcomes?
Right now I’m afraid all outcomes are possible. We’ll know more soon. I’m sorry. It would be misleading to say more right now.
It’s most probably a hemorrhagic stroke. I did zoology. Animals also have strokes. Even reptiles. So.
It’s fine. He’ll never retire and he’ll never die.
Already? People are sending shit already?
It’s from Lawrence.
Call him and tell him that is not fucking appreciated.
Can I get five? We need to talk to you.
Obviously the board, the nominating committee, has a plan in the event of Logan’s incapacitation …
Do I need to hear this right now?
You do. The guy’s an ox, we know that, but—
The stock is not in great shape as it is and—
I am not thinking about the stock right now, okay?
I know. I know.
Nor are we. Nor is anyone.
Nevertheless. If we carry on, on – the current trajectory in terms of his – consciousness – we need to announce a plan by around six-thirty before the markets open to avoid a lot of – funky chowder.
‘Funky chowder’?
If you want to— We’ve set up through here?
What have you set up?
You’re gonna want somewhere to – be. We spoke with a hospital trustee, just to make sure everybody knows who’s who around here.
This isn’t a war room as yet.
But if we need one, it’s available.
There’s so much going on. This must be very confusing.
Can’t we just talk here?
You know Connor’s invited Willa down?
Ugh. Here? Why would he do that?
I don’t know. He saw an empty bed and it made him horny? I have no idea. — But listen, so I was thinking – this must be tough on Marcia.
Yeah? You’re thinking that? What? Will she put all her inheritance into gold, or oil?
No, look I know the trust only comes into play if certain things happen—
He’s dead. Or brain dead.
But I was thinking, wouldn’t it be nice for Dad to wake up and for us all to have signed, like he wanted? A nice gesture?
And if he dies? We’ve signed over to Marcia, basically, the power to choose the new Dad.
So, for the record, you’re declining to sign the change of trust?
‘For the record’? What is this, McCarthyism? I’m not declining. I’m just not – clining.
Okay. It just seems a bit shitty. Under the circumstances …  ?
What circumstances?
Well, you did make her husband’s brain explode …
Fuck off—
Jesus. Hi.
We’ve implied we might be making a totally unrelated donation to the hospital?
There’s a bathroom through there. I have Dewi and Asha from the nominating committee on the line. Kendall’s here and you’re on speaker, guys.
Hi, Kendall, it’s Dewi. So sorry about the news.
Likewise. How’s he doing?
Er – we don’t know.
As you know, our standing plan, in the event of Logan’s … ‘absence’ is we separate his CEO and Chairman roles.
You become acting CEO, Frank stays on as COO and steps up from Vice Chairman to acting Chair—
Look, my dad is my focus right now.
Of course. It’s just – there’s a problem in terms of – you know, in terms of the optics if what happened between you two today gets out?
I don’t know what you’re talking about.
Sure. Well—
And then there’s the problem with Frank?
As in?
Logan fired him. And promoted Roman.
Roman? Jesus.
So, in this, uhh, situation, with your father having you know, cast some doubt on you in a – in a way, and Frank, we just wonder if …
It’s a difficult position.
He didn’t tell you about Roman?
I’m sorry, I can’t get into this right now.
Of course. You’re in no fit state.
But here’s my take. My dad got sick today. Right? I don’t know, nobody knows when he started acting out of character, but he didn’t seem great from the morning on, and, there’s no paper on any of the moves made today, right, Gerri?
Nothing meaningful.
It was words and words are – what? Nothing. Complicated airflow. So, if I was saying what     today? It would be nothing.
Well that would certainly make things simpler from our point of view? And simple’s good. Can you get the family behind it?
Yes.
And Frank?
Sure.
Frank? Pal. Listen, you’ve heard, right? Can I possibly get five?
We’re here for you, Marcia.
It’ll be okay.
You know, the irony is for all we spend the US actually has the worst health outcomes of any developed nation.
Easy. Yeah?
Hey, don’t shoot the messenger. Because he would   stand a great chance of recovery.
I’m here for you too. This is so unfair, he’s a good man – he let me come to his birthday lunch, he offered me a job … He doesn’t deserve this. If there’s anything I can do let me know.
Actually there is something.
Great.
Can you go to the apartment and get his bed things and slippers? With the dark checks. For if, for when he wakes up? You don’t mind, do you?
No. I’d be delighted. Not delighted … Happy. Willing.
Marcia, we can get the housekeeper, or the driver or Colin to—
I don’t need that fly buzzing in my face.
Don’t fuck it up!
Listen, Greg, I need a favor. Dad wanted us to sign some paperwork today – it’s in some envelopes back at home, I need you to bring it in. Don’t look so worried, man! You can pretend like you’ve got a job working for FedEx?
Better not fuck this one up. I don’t want Logan Roy’s newspapers going through my trash cans.
Well then you shouldn’t do so much meth.
We still have to try to save his life, right? Even though he’s a horrible person?
I believe so. I think technically, that’s the case. South Park
What are people saying?
Oh just rumors, ‘taken to the hospital’. Some of Twitter says he’s dead. A good deal of – of – rejoicing at our father’s potential demise. Can you screengrab these fuckers who are saying shit?
Shiv, it’s Sarah. Sorry, something’s come up. Can I call?
Scan. And the news is out.
Okay? Right. Well— So, um, listen, I don’t want to even think about this but I just spoke to the nominating committee.
The thing is, that the plan is to announce that I take over from Dad. That’s the plan.
Well, no.
Excuse me?
Let’s not— We’re waiting for the results of the scan, so it’s a pointless conversation.
Okay, well, let’s talk about it—
I can’t talk about it, I’m upset.
Hey, I’m upset too!
Not too upset to go and fucking plot with the suits?
Oh fuck you. I could – I could hardly hear them for the blood rushing in my ears and—

Yes there’s a plan – that’s what I’m fucking telling you!
Well I’m not sure—
Shiv, that’s what we have to talk about, me and Frank will take over.
Well Frank was fired, so?
Okay, well let’s discuss – and just see where we are and—
We’re not doing this. If Dad dies I do not want to be talking about this shit when he dies.
He won’t die.
Yes? Hi, this is Isobel Silva at  , I’m sorry to be in contact at this difficult time, but we’ve just emailed you the lede of a story – we’re looking into the events of the last twenty-four hours and I wondered if you’d like to comment?
What events? What story? How Logan Roy was going to make you Head of Waystar and then withdrew the offer and how his brain hemorrhage has created a power vacuum at the heart of the company. Did you have a comment on that?
Okay, I’ve got no comment. But off the record, yeah? You’re a vulture. You’re a fucking piece of shit, and I hope you’ve got a good contract cos if you ever need a job anywhere else in news, anywhere, I’ll see what I can do to make sure you’re fucked, forever. Goodnight.
Hi? I’m really sorry but I don’t have any money to pay for the cab?
I’m sorry, sir, do I know you?
I was here earlier. I got assaulted a little? Can you pay for the cab, please? She said she’d call, but maybe she didn’t because there’s an emergency and anyway I don’t have any money, so could you pay for my cab, because it’s an emergency? And I gave my last twenty to the family, for Coke? Bottles of Coke.
Sir, I’m sorry, I don’t know who you are.
So, basically he won’t lend me the money, so he owes you your money. You better give me the money, dude. Look you two need to figure this out, because basically, one of you guys hasn’t got fourteen dollars, okay? Look, can you just call Mrs Roy?
Can you?
I – I don’t know her number?
Oh, hi, Mrs Roy.
I’m so sorry. So – weird.
I actually like hospitals. Lots of people don’t, but they’re safe.
Is that bubble okay?
I don’t— I assume so?
The weird thing for me, is I was – I’d been intending to – talk to Logan and then, make a proposal. I’ve actually been meaning to ask for his blessing for a while, but now it’s very difficult.
Right.
I’ve been carrying the ring around for months!
You need to find the right time for these conversations.
Right. The weird thing I’m thinking now is, do you think Logan would still like to be asked? I know he can’t reply. But would he appreciate the gesture? If he was told about it later? Or even in the case of the worst – would that be nice to have asked, his body?
Umm—
I guess my question is, I’d really like to ask her, but do you think Logan would be angry if I asked Shiv without asking him, even though it’s hard to ask him because he’s – you know?
You should do whatever you think is right, Tom.
You know what, I’m just going to— Excuse me! Is this bubble, is it okay for a little bubble to go into him—?
All fine, it’s not our first rodeo.
Thank you. Not entirely appropriate language. This is a human being. Not a horse.
Hey. Do you want to talk? Because I’ve got something—
Apparently I need to get a briefing. Sarah? What’s going on?
I’m actually, I wanted, in case you needed me to be available—
Sure, come on in.
Fine – I’ll be with you shortly. Instantly, really. I wanted to be near.
Sorry, Tom, could you give us a minute? So?
So – you don’t need to get into this, I’ve got it, but so you know the territory— Daniel called me.
Joyce’s husband?
He said he thinks something bad could have happened? That could hurt Joyce’s campaign.
Oh what the fuck now?
He says there’s been a hack on a dating site. Filthy Rich? For married people who want to fuck around?
Delightful. Was he on it?
He says – it’s complicated.
Oh great.  . Of course it is.

I’ll do it.
Yeah because—
It’s fine. Get me this profile. Then talk to Daniel, ask him if someone was being horrible, if someone was being shitty, what the worst thing they could find was? Okay?
They’re gonna give us the results?
Okay. Fuck. You okay, man?
He’ll be fine. He’s probably in there eating a fucking chicken bucket and checking the market.
He’s had a hemorrhagic stroke. A bleed in the deep right hemisphere put pressure on his thalamus and brainstem and that’s what caused loss of consciousness.
So, what? Do you operate?
We don’t do that for deep bleeds, especially in older patients.
He’s not an ‘older patient’.
Dude, he just turned eighty.
But physically, he’s basically still in his seventies. And he’s in great shape. Thirty years.
The evidence is that operating in these situations isn’t worthwhile.
Well you can’t do nothing.
We’re carrying out regular observations. Hopefully, we’ll see an improvement soon.
That’s not good enough, right, Doctor Judith?
It’s an excellent department.
Well thanks for your input but you’ll understand if we check our options – my assistant’s spoken to Ann Wieman at NYU and we might move Dad there.
No. He stays here. He gets better here.
Well, we can discuss. We’ll discuss and get back to you.
No. No discussion. I’m his next of kin, I’m his proxy – I’m in charge. Thank you.
Good. We’ll move Logan to a suite in Greenberg. I’ll show you the way.
I’m sorry, Ken. How is the old bastard?
Not great. He’ll be fine.
You okay, Kenny?
Maybe. Yeah. Look, I don’t know what the fuck I’m doing. I need to get back in there – this is nuts. I’ll call you. Look, we don’t know what’s going on. He could be fine, he could not. Either way he’s not going to be back tomorrow. So long story short: will you carry on as COO and step up on the board and—?
Become Acting Chairman?
Yes.
No.
What?
He fired me, Ken.
I don’t know if he even knew what he was saying? If his brain was working.
His brain was working fine.
Look, whatever else, there’s no proof, legally, that yesterday even happened …
That’s not the problem.
What’s the problem?
I just don’t want to be Chairman. I am just an attendant lord, here to swell a scene or two.
Look – this is a horrible day. But it could also be a, a – positive day. Me and you? Yeah? Me CEO, you Chairman. We could do great things together— What do you need, Frank?
A jazillion dollars in unmarked bitcoin. I don’t have a price, Ken.
Frank, I don’t understand?
Just— We’ll talk. There’s a lot of mess to be cleaned up, Kendall, but you can do it, son. You can.
There’s nothing I can say to change your mind?
I’m sorry about your father. And good luck, Kenny.
So I asked Greg to bring the change of trust—
What?
—and when he brings them, we should sign them.
I’m not doing anything without my lawyer.
Well I’m going to sign and I’m getting Connor to sign so that’s going to make you look pretty fucking heartless when you don’t? Oooh, scary look. You hit me again I will ask them to sedate you.
Greg, did you find the contracts Roman asked for?
Yes, I’m on it, I have them!
I think you have the wrong ones.
Oh. Okay?
That’s possible. So—
Um. Right. What shall I do—?
Look, there’s a lot of confusion. Cuz, if you have any doubt, maybe you can’t find them and that might be simplest?
Uh-huh? But if I do?
Don’t bring them.
Did he change his mind?
No, I’m just telling you – don’t bring them in.
Okay. So what’s the chain of command here? It’s— Are you the more senior sibling?
Greg. This is a favor I’d like you to do for me, and I’d like you to be discreet. It’s simple. You stay for a while, you can’t find them, you come back. Okay? Thank you.
Nothing yet.
What?
Um, we’re good. We’ve been digging and I’ve got the situation covered.
It’s okay?
Shall we just do it tomorrow?
It’s fine, just tell me.
Okay there’s a picture related to his profile. Embedded in some chat. You won’t want to see it—
If I won’t want to see it, I need to see it.  –  Is that— What …? Is that … an asshole?
It’s his asshole.
No. I can’t— No. I’m not contactable tonight, okay? No.
Um, look, so I know you don’t want to talk about this, but I’m just informing you Roman as a board member, and Shiv as a shareholder, I’ll be taking temporary charge as CEO and Chairman. Frank is not interested in the position at present and therefore—
I’m sorry but even if we were talking about it, which we’re not, it wouldn’t necessarily be you, bro.
I’m sorry then who the fuck would it be?
I don’t know. Anyone. It could be me.
Are you insane?
Dad just made me COO?
I don’t think so, dude. Dad wasn’t thinking straight.
Well, I think he was.
You, the ‘Chief Operating Officer’? If that wasn’t a sign he was loco in the coco I don’t know what is.
I don’t see it that way.
It was a position, Rome, he was playing you, do you even know what it fucking involves? He conked out midgame.
Are you saying I’m a dipshit?
No. Rome! I love you, man, but you’re not a serious person.
Fuck you! He’s alive, you’re not the fucking boss—
Look, hey, let’s not throw our shit around. We’re in the middle. This is why we just hold tight, no sudden moves.
Well we need to move. The markets are going to want to know who’s behind the wheel. We need to control the narrative.
‘Control the narrative’. You probably yell that when you cum.
Fuck you. Everyone knows he’s in the hospital, we have to say something.
But no one knows how serious it is, so we don’t have to say anything.
We’re required to announce. There are rules, there are laws.
Oh no, the law? We couldn’t possibly break the law.
Karolina, has a CEO ever been out of action and people haven’t been told?
Not that I can think of. There was Apple but—?
But can we drag our feet on this, till we figure out the moves?
Well, once we know, there’s a duty to shareholders to let people—
But I don’t know what we know! It’s unclear. It could be flu, it could be an allergic reaction?
Oh come on! Look at the fucking orchids! It’s like we’re being held hostage at the Honolulu Airport.
But if we wanted to say – something, other than what is …
It’s called a lie, Shiv. When you say the thing that’s not. That’s a lie.
We need to make a holding statement. But of course I’m open to your suggestions on how we finesse it.
Thank you. We’ll make a decision shortly.
Lawrence. How you doing?
Kendall—
Yeah so listen I’m just calling to issue a reminder. Your pecker’s in my pocket, okay, Dickless Dickleby? I just got bothered by some piece of guttershit about my dad and what went down yesterday. I’m just making sure you weren’t planning a move in that direction?
Well, Vaulter and all our satellite sites have editorial independence, as set out in our agreement—
You know what that piece of paper is to me? Nothing. I’d jerk off on that paper and send it to you as a greeting card. You do what I say. Let others say what they want but we stay dark. You get me? So Simon Says: ‘Fingers on lips, motherfucker.’
It’s been a tough day for Ken.
It has. I feel sorry for him.
And I don’t want to talk about this now but the fact is, if he becomes Acting CEO, he’ll end up CEO.
Yeah, right, that’s the flow.
And maybe we’re happy? It’s just a question of who would Dad want to be in charge—?
That’s right.
I tell you what he really   need, is Dad waking up and going apeshit at him for trying to seize the company while he was unconscious?
No, he does not need that.
I guess, and I don’t want to get into this, but I think we need to just cut off the whole Kendall CEO thing. Because otherwise it could get painful?
Well, I’m not looking for it but I guess I’m already COO so another small step and—?
It won’t be you.
Because?
Come on?
I don’t know what that means?
Yes you do.
It doesn’t matter who does it, it’s temporary, anyone will do.
Sure. Anyone. Tom? Karl?
Prick. Eva?
Cunt. Frank?
Basically dead.
I mean it could be anyone. It’s only temporary?
So who? Someone Dad trusts. Dad doesn’t trust anyone. Apart from Frank. And he fired Frank for shits and giggles. Gerri?
I don’t love Gerri, I don’t even like Gerri, but I don’t hate Gerri.
I’ll talk to her.
Logan Roy, CEO and Chairman of Waystar Corporation, has been admitted to New York Presbyterian Hospital after suffering an unspecified medical emergency. He is undergoing treatment and is currently listed as being in a serious condition. The Waystar board has scheduled an emergency board meeting and will make a statement in due course.
So what do you think I do?
What did she say?
Roman said bring in the papers, Shiv said don’t bring in the papers?
I guess you need to decide which one of them is more important?
I guess – Roman’s in the firm but Shiv seems like more … I don’t know, bossy?
Well, I don’t know.
And I don’t know which slippers. Is checked the same as plaid? Cos then you have gingham. And tartan. It’s a fucking criss-cross minefield.
Fuck the slippers, Greg. You have to strategize.
I’m trying to strategize, Mom, with you but you won’t strategize!
Can you just – stay?
Just stall? Stalling doesn’t seem proactive. Is stalling proactive?
I don’t know.
I’m trying to brainstorm with you, Mom. But you’re not bringing anything to the table!
I bought a cookie to split. I assumed we wouldn’t be able to face a donut right now.
Is it definitely his?
I mean, an asshole’s like a fingerprint, isn’t it, so we will be able to – tell, eventually.
Is an asshole like a fingerprint?
Um, you mean because of the – the puckers?
The google on this is – it’s, it’s not one of those searches with a really
Can we find out if an asshole has—?
Hi. Excuse me, guys, quick question, and sorry to bother you but does an asshole have a fingerprint?
I’m sorry?
Is every asshole unique?
Um, I don’t know. Do you know?
Thanks, guys! Someone fell asleep in asshole class … Can we chase that?
They’re pretty anonymous, right? I mean, could you pick out yours?
Was the account in Daniel’s name?
His credit card details are in there, anonymized so, it might not come out. But it might.
Could we say the profile was set up by a friend? As a joke?
Who’s the friend, what’s their name, why, when, how, where’s the card, it’d last like, three to five hours?
We could say he meant to take a good, old-fashioned dick pic and got the angle wrong?
‘He’s such a dick he couldn’t even snap his own dick’? I don’t know if that helps …
Joyce wants to see you. Do you have the time? Do you want me to say no?
I don’t know. I don’t fucking know.
Listen, can I get a moment alone with you do you think …  ?
Have you seen this?
I’m so sorry about your father.
Thank you. Could you give us a minute?
Oh come on, I am not the same as her.
Lawrence is running a story about how the company’s in turmoil.
Don’t we own him? ‘Shit Show at the Fuck Factory’?
Uncertainty, discord. That is not a good story. ‘Family Gets Behind Other Member of Family’, that’s a good story.
Fuck them. When Jobs was croaking, Apple didn’t say anything.
We’re in a hospital, Shiv. Everyone knows. We can’t just prop him up and wave his hand and say he’s fine like they did in the Politburo or fucking  .
I like the sound of that.
Look you can’t put a value on a human life. Except in our case you rather precisely can because when trading opens tomorrow we’re going to drop like a stone. The only question is, what’s the bottom? I think I’m the best option.
I just want to say – if you need me to go get coffee or sandwiches or step up from regional parks to run North America, I will, I can. That’s just an offer on the table.
Fuck off, Tom.
Fuck off, Kendall. Don’t talk to Tom like that.
It’s okay. It’s fine.
I was about to be announced, how can I not be the logical choice?
You were   announced, but then you weren’t, Ken. Look, I hate to say this but the only thing we know for certain, for absolute certain, is Dad didn’t want you to be boss. So if there was a list of the seven billion people on earth, you’re one of the very few people we’d know for sure Dad did not want running this company.
Dad fired you, man.
He did not fire me. He said it was just going to take a little longer.
He said that to be nice. What he meant was: You’re not up to it, and it’s going to be someone else.
The board are offering this to me. I don’t need your backing.
Well you do kind of need it, really?
I think you do. Without it, after what Dad did to you, we could take any appointment to court.
Jesus, Shiv, we’re going to court now?
Hey, I didn’t want to talk about this, remember?!
Look, what have you got against me?
Nothing.
Nothing?
What, do you want me to actually say?
Yes.
You lack killer instinct, you’re wet, you’re green, you’re intellectually insecure—
Oh my god! Bullshit.
You’re not emotionally strong enough, you have addiction issues—
No, no. I’ve heard enough.
I don’t think all that. I’m just trying to be Dad’s voice—
Bravo. It was an excellent impression. I just want to say – I’m not getting involved.
Good!
But Shiv’s right. I’m not saying I’d be a better CEO … That’s unsaid.
Hey – pal – why don’t you go make out with Willa?
Okay, you decide, I don’t even want to know. I just observe. I’m a UN White Helmet.
Who else are you going to get?
I think Shiv would do a great job.
Thanks, baby. No way.
She doesn’t work in the company and has no experience of the company and the markets would freak. But apart from that, I agree with you.
But we have options.
Sure, you could all ask for morphine. So you can carry on in your painless dreamworld where the orchids dance and the company’s run by a – hipster – fucking unicorn!
Look, I don’t want to do it. Which is ironic because that probably means I’m actually the person best suited to do it.
Response times can vary.
Hello, this is Greg.
Greg, how are you doing?
I’m not dawdling.
Listen, you’re at the apartment, right?
Um, just—
I know you’re getting PJs and all that shit. Just, pick up a sweater maybe. Also. My dad’s, okay?
Okay, which …?
Doesn’t matter. Not something washed. Something he’s worn, maybe, if you find one.
V-neck or crew. I guess it doesn’t matter, right?
Just smell it. Okay. Jesus. I just want something that smells of him, okay. I just want that. Is that enough for you?
Okay, dude. That’s nice. Sorry. I’ll … sniff some stuff.
Just whatever. And don’t tell anyone, or I’ll cut your dick off. And don’t forget those papers we talked about. And also – thanks. And fuck off.
So, Gerri. How you doing?
Oh fine. This is where they brought Baird, so it’s a little—
Baird?
My husband. Shiv’s godfather …?
Ohh. Does he – with the tortoise?
Yeah.
Yeah. Of course! How is he? Yeah, no I do, I remember. Anyhoo thanks, for captaining us through this shitstorm. You do a good job, Gerri. You are a real good job-doer, my friend. Look, I’m not great at the whole corporate flirt, I’d rather just lube up and fuck, you know?
I see.
Yeah – so, look, for me and Shiv the Kendall thing doesn’t work, so we’re thinking. General Counsel, you know where the bodies are buried, you probably buried them ‘ha-ha’, so, you’d have the family’s support to step in and take the reins. Okay?
Well that’s a generous offer but I’m going to have to decline.
Right. Can I ask why?
Why don’t I want the job that makes your brain explode?
Okay. But— Gerri, excuse me but I’ve always thought of you, and I mean this in the best possible way, as a stone-cold killer bitch?
And you said you couldn’t flirt … Shush now.
What are we talking about?
Tortoises and lube.
Great. Love all that stuff. Very happy to join in those conversations.
It’s nearly four a.m.?
I couldn’t sleep. Put the kids to bed and I felt like I was missing all the fun. So?
How are they doing?
The kids. They’re okay.
Would you mind bringing them in tomorrow? Just so they can say their … their, hellos.
How are you feeling?
Good. Yeah. I don’t know. Calm then – then, yeah. How am I feeling? Fuck. Ask me another.
Jesus, what a day for you.
Yeah. The nominating committee want me to be the big boss.
‘Yay.’
‘Yay.’ Acting. But Shiv and Roman won’t back me. Because of what Dad said at lunch.
Jesus, your family is so – fucked. I mean I’m sorry but— Is that— Kendall? I assume you’re aware that you’re prodding me?
What can I say. Adrenalin. I don’t know. It’s just my body. I’m glad you’re here.
Yeah, I can tell.
So, man, look, I’ve been thinking and this is my vision: We go for it. Me and you. CEO and COO. Me and my Homey Romey?
I thought I was a fuckhead?
A dipshit, and you said that?
You said I wasn’t serious.
It’s been a long night. But seriously, me and you, bro. I can teach you — and you can, you know, teach me.
And Shiv?
You know what Shiv’s like. She’s a daddy’s girl. She wants to play it safe. We’re the ones with the nuts to revolutionize.
Okay – I’m not uninterested.
Alright, then. Let’s fucking do it.
Only thing … Gerri turned down the top job. Does that mean something?
Are you fucking with me?
No.
This your move. Scare me off? Who asked Gerri?
It was mooted.
It was ‘mooted’? By who? Fucking Moot-zart? The Count of Mooty Cristo? Did you moot?
I’m just telling you what I know. So we trust each other.
I can’t believe my dad’s dying and I’m having to deal with this asshole’s asshole.
You know, there are men in the world who would never do this. And I’m one of them. To be clear. If that wasn’t—
Connor Roy. Big fan. . I mean I find your policy prescriptions laughable. But personally. Huge fan.
I’m so sorry about your father.
Sarah’s found us somewhere horrible.
Joyce, I’m so sorry he cheated on you. You deserve better.
He didn’t cheat on me.
Oh? Okay. But – it was his credit card? And his laptop?
Someone stole them.
Right? And did he report it?
He has multiple credit cards and multiple laptops. He’s a very successful businessman with a number of enemies, any one of whom could be targeting him or me for any number of reasons.
Joyce? What? If this comes out we’re just saying it wasn’t him?
Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. What should I do? This is just the  fucking day.
It’s okay. We – we— Look, let’s cool this off. Have you talked to him?
No. Yes. Kind of. If he fucks this for me, I will kill him. He’s in Portland. We Skyped. I thought there was someone else in the room but it was my echo. It all went wrong. He’s such a fucking— I don’t know. Do you trust him?
That’s not my area, Joyce.
You think I should leave him?
We’re weeks out from a Senate Primary.
So I’m stuck with him? Would it be crazy, to – focus-group the – the scenarios?
Yes. Yes, Joyce, that would be fucking crazy. Look, we can manage this. And you know, you need to do what feels right. No one can judge you. Except the voters, of course.
Oh come on, man. Not cool.
C’mon. Family get-together.
So, listen, I’ve asked Roman to be Acting COO—
Actual COO.
To my Acting CEO.
And you said?
I said, why not?
Snake.
Sis, please. I’m trying to bring us together here. I’m mediating.
Well I’m saying no.
Me too.
I thought you were a fucking White Helmet?
Sometimes the peacekeeper has to go to shoot a maniac on the perimeter.
Why would you say no to this and yes to Gerri?
Gerri’s been with the company for twenty years. Dad trusts her.

Yeah well, she doesn’t want it.
And so in my opinion we should find someone else, temporary.
Like who?
Someone neutral, anyone. Eva. What’s he called, American Psycho? Or Karl?
Karl? Yeah? You trust him? And what if it isn’t temporary? What if he uses his position to make it permanent?
He wouldn’t do that?
Wouldn’t he? How do you know?
He’s nice, he brought coffee.
Oh he bought coffee? Then we should definitely let him take control of the company?
Dude, Karl’s not going to—
It’s a gamble. It’s either me and Roman and us as a family. Or it’s Eva and Karl or some fuck-droid from the deep state of the company. They could take the company out of our hands, and we’d never get near it again. If Dad wakes up – and he’s frail and he’s looking at the endgame – do you want to be the one who tells him his family business isn’t family- run anymore? I mean, maybe you could get away with it? His favorite …
Fuck you.
But maybe you wouldn’t stay his favorite if you gave away the company? Look, we need a statement by six-thirty. So, you have to think, bullshit aside, who do you think, really, Dad would prefer?
Stop. Look, there’s something I have to say.
Tom, I’m not in the mood for fucking around—
Siobhan Roy, will you marry me?
Are you serious?
I love you. And I wanted to do something to make all this better. And I thought, while your dad’s still with us, wouldn’t that be nice? We can do a quick wedding.
What is it about my dad dying in a – a – sterile environment that screams ‘big romantic gesture’ to you?
It’s – it’s a horrible day. I thought this was something nice?
Tom, you can’t balance it out like that? I’m not gonna give you a – blowjob when your dog dies, yeah?
Look, no, fine. I misjudged it. I get it. Bad call.
No, I’m sorry. It’s fine. Look. Why don’t you do this again properly another time. Yeah? Let’s not have this as the moment?
No, exactly. This isn’t it. This didn’t happen. Abort.
Good.
Good.
But so you know, sure, whatever.
Yeah?
Sure. When it happens, yes. Such a shit show.
What?
My family.
Our family.
Hey hey hey! So I got the slippers!
Thank you, Greg. Just—
So you got the slippers. I guess that makes you Prince Charming?
I guess so.
So, you’re saying you want to fuck Marcia?
What? No. Why would you—?
That’s what you said—
No it isn’t—
You said you were Prince Charming.
No, you said that.
I’m kidding.
Uh-huh. How’s Logan?
Well I don’t think he’s going to be wearing those anytime soon.
Oh, shit. You know that he gave me a job?
What job?
I don’t know.
Okay.
Do you know when I start?
No obviously I don’t know, why would I know?
I don’t know, I guess I thought you all talked. I thought people might have been talking about me, what to do about me?
Yeah, no, everyone’s been talking about you the whole time.
I get it. Uh-huh.
Look, when you figure all that out, come in and see me – I’ll look after you, okay? Seriously.
Hey, cuz, you got the papers?
What – oh, dang! Roman, shit, I’m sorry, bro. I was so caught up in the, I asked the doorman and then, I got up and then I was thinking about your dad. That is   dumb.
Okay, we’re going to have to announce, where are we at?
While Dad is ill, the family proposes that Kendall should run the company, with Roman as COO.
I endorse this decision.
Okay. I’ll inform the committee of the family position, and board approval pending, we’ll announce. Congratulations, Kendall.
Yes, congratulations.
You should get some rest.
Look forward to working with you, bro.
Good luck. I have to say for the record, I personally believe this to be a total fucking disaster.
Okay, good. Kendall, listen, we need to talk—
Okay. There’s really no nice way to say this, but your dad has slit our throats and we’re now bleeding to death.
What is this?
We have a huge debt problem.
What are you—? No.
Three billion.
Fuck off. I’d know.
No one knows. Me and Frank.","[set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), {'Dad', 'Shiv'}, set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(), set(),

3,"What about Dad??
Yeah, your dad. Hence the debt.
What the— Gerri? What the fuck is going on? Was he secretly funding the war in Afghanistan – and paying LeBron James to lead the fucking infantry?
’95, Logan needed cash badly for the studio acquisition. He took out a loan, through the family holding company—
Where it’s hidden from view?
The company’s private and he knew that, besides Frank, none of the other board members would see what was happening. And he added the loan to the company’s already considerable debt.
Okay. Okay, we can deal.
It’s secured against Waystar stock – and when the stock hits one-thirty we’ve breached the covenant and they can pursue repayment in full. Which, if they went through on, would eviscerate us.
But they won’t, they’ll renegotiate, right?
Well. That depends.
Uh-huh.
The banks know the man they invested in can no longer function. As far as they’re concerned you’re just some guy. With hair. So, it’s a question. Do they stick or twist?
You’re making it quite fucking hard to savor this moment, Gerri.
Hey.
Got a cigarette?
Sure. I know it’s a weird time. But I have some weed if you want to smoke a bone?
I’ve just been appointed head of one the biggest media companies in the world and I’ve also been in rehab for drug addiction and it’s possible my dad might die at any second – so excuse me if I don’t get stoned out of my gourd with you right now, cuz. . But a cigarette would be great.
Is he going to be okay?
I don’t know.
We had hoped to see a response by now. There’s hope. But if we don’t see one soon, that’s not promising. What we do know is: he’s stable. So, if you want to grab some sleep, this is a good time.
Night, Dad. See you soon.
Stay strong, Dad. Keep fighting.
Dad, I think I’ve finally worked out who I am and what I’m doing with my life. There’s a job I want. It’s called President of the United States.
Hi. Sorry, Marcia, it’s just everyone’s going home and I don’t know where to go?
I don’t know, Greg – a hotel?
Can you get me the Waystar stock price at close last night please?
How is he?
Good. A little clearer. He tried to put on a sock. —
Hey. Are you awake?
Mom. Obviously I’m awake.
Are you stoned?
No! Obviously I’m not stoned. I haven’t had breakfast, what kind of monster do you think I am?
And you’ve got ideas, in case they want ideas?
Mom, don’t micromanage!
I’m not micromanaging. Have they given you an advance?
It’s my first day! And you kind of are micromanaging, Mom. Okay? ‘To the moon and back, bumblebee’ to you too.
Okay! Just wanted to say goodbye.
Have you looked at the numbers? Poor Ken. He’s like dysentery for the stock price. You’re walking into a burning barn.
Just paying – homage. What’s that? You miss me? I miss you too! Maybe we should arrange a date when ‘she’s’ not around.
Weird.
You’re weird! Okay!
Tom, listen, will you come with me?
Ugh. I gotta stand firm on this one, baby. It’s a huge-y, first morning stepping up?
Tell them you went to see the big boss. Please? C’mon.
Arghhhhhh! Don’t make me choose! It’s a man’s right not to choose.
Thirty seconds?
I’m getting the kids ready. Malaya, can you get him his cup?
Yeah, this is dumb but – bank call this morning. And I just wanted to ask—
What bank – our old joint account?
Um, no, no, Rava!   bank. ICBC who’ve apparently bankrolled the old man for years— I said?
Oh yeah, sorry. I’m just in a rush.
Yeah. Two minutes. Do I play hard-on or softcock? What’s your read?
Ken. Talk to your people. Malaya, it’s good to let him pour it himself, thanks.
You’re just, you’re always smart – and just … hard-on or softcock?
Ken, can’t we do this later? But no one likes a softcock. Iver! No!
What’s he doing? Let me: Hello! Ive – listen to me, you need to be cool with your sister. Alright? Remember your strategies?
We have to go. I can’t do this now, Ken? Let’s eat something sometime, yeah? Okay? I’m sorry. Why don’t you ask Roman?
Roman? Rava? C’mon.
Out of ten?
A seven.
You’re in decent shape. Little sloppy. But I can get you tight as a drum.
Okay well, I trust Pax. Pax says you’re the best.
Pax is the best.
He’s a prick. But he knows the best places. He’s the only person I trust on food. So I thought, I should trust him on, like, the opposite of food.
Only thing I’m gonna say, Roman. I take my shit seriously, that’s why I have the reputation I do, so you got to be on board for this regime.
Dude, no need for the speech, I’m down.
Five-thirty, every day is the regime.
Serious as cancer. Seriouser. Fucking— money cancer. I gotta check out. I’m rolling COO now.
Uh-huh.
 Operating Officer. Waystar Royco. If it operates, I chief it. Five-thirty is perfect.
That’s a.m., yeah?
Sure. Cool. Because the other five-thirty I’ll be – being an agent of change and you know, sacking people.
How’s that now?
A six?
Bullshit. I can go four more?
Argh! I think you popped something.
Hahahah. Nope. Señor, you’re done! —
Ask her to wait there.
Hey ‘she’s’ here!
It’s just something that happens. The morphine—
I know. I’m fine.
Is everything okay?
Lovely to see you, Siobhan. Tom?
I’m afraid I can’t stay.
We will settle any outstanding fees and non-disclosure agreement with her.
Really? She’s good—
It’s best.

Nothing. Staff. So! Good to see you.
Likewise. Look, I know you said he wasn’t great, but I was passing and I just
Oh that’s sweet. He’s not seeing people right now.
Sure, but I just thought I’d pop up even if he’s grumpy—?
It’s best you don’t.
It’s okay, I’ll take the earbashing!
I’m afraid that’s out of the question.
Um. I mean, could you just see and check he hasn’t, changed his mind?
Of course. Let me go and ask.
Hi? Shiv. Logan’s daughter? Thanks so much for everything by the way.
That’s quite alright.
Yeah well, much appreciated.
And how does he seem today?
Oh. You know.
Yeah, we heard all about the sock?
It’ll stabilize.
I know. I know it will. So, I’ve been thinking and I’ve got a new strategy for the call?
Uh-huh?
Hey. Don’t look so fucking nervous. It’s making me nervous.
I’m relaxed! It’s just maybe a little late considering the gravity and the need to get the relationship right.
Absolutely. The new strategy is really just a refinement of all this great work— It goes— Well the working title is: ‘fuck you’.
Uh-huh?
Hi, I have Mr Polk.
Uh-huh. What do you think?
I think – I may need a little more explanation before—
My dad’s a bastard. They need to know I’m a bastard too. Right?
Right but—
Great. Hey, Mr Polk?
Hi. Kendall, good to connect.
Likewise. Great. So? You wanna go?
Er, sure, or why don’t you go?
Um, well, we just wanted to make contact, given where we are.
Uh-huh. We are concerned.
Absolutely. Now obviously, look, the main thing is we just handle this very calmly because the last thing either of us want is for this rather private arrangement my father made to cause waves?
Oh absolutely.
But I guess the issue is, we owe you three-point-two billion.
Three-point-two-five.
Hey, I was rounding down!
We round up.
Secured against Waystar stock which is undergoing some temporary turbulence due to sector-wide factors. So – I guess what I’d like to know is what your position will be if we have a sustained breach of the stock price and we fall out of compliance with our debt covenant?
Okay, well, if the stock drops, we’re entitled to ask for repayment in full.
Uh-huh. Exactly. Technically. So what – what will we do here in, reality?
If it breaches one-thirty, you’ve broken the covenant and we will want repayment.
Right – I know. But really?
Seriously.
I get it. That’s your starting position, but we will want to restructure, and—
Look, here’s where I’m at. We’re not crazy about the media sector, we’re not crazy about how your father has treated our relationship. And our position is to seek recoupment.
Oh come on, man, fuck off. Hello?
Hi.
Yeah? C’mon. Real world. Can we start to negotiate?
That’s our position. If the stock drops below one-thirty, you’re in breach and we want our money back.
Fine, well let’s keep talking—
If you need to talk to me maybe it’s better if we go through an intermediary. I’m not a particular fan of foul language and I don’t like to be insulted. Thank you. Good morning.

Uggghhhh.
Give me a level?
Fuuuuuuuuck! That was brutal.
You were listening in?
Of course I was in! I’m COO.
Are they for real. Would they squeeze us?
Well obviously they could.
But why would they? They won’t, will they?
Relax, bro. New trainer. It’ll be okay.
No it fucking necessarily won’t. If this became public. We could nosedive. We could death spiral here.
Fine, dude, I was only trying to be nice, that was a fucking shit show and you handled it like a moron is the truth.
Fuck off.
Fuck you.
It’s fine. Just— We need, next time, to have a more considered strategy. I’ve got a portfolio of options?
I have a pitch?
Sorry, bunch of calls. Shiv is trying to reach you?
Finally entering the Death Star!
I can’t fucking believe it. Can you? Fucking – where does she get off?
Just can’t help feeling this is a little like my mom’s taking me to my first day at Death Star school. Such a sexy little mommy.
Greg Hirsch? I’m, I ah … believe I’m working here, as of today?
Okay? Umm— I have no – record of that.
Well I’ve definitely got a job, so?
I’m sure. I just don’t – have anything?
Okay. Um? Then, what, should I just head on in and have a mooch about?
Um, no.
Okay. So, what do you suggest?
Well what is your job title and who appointed you?
Um, job— Not entirely sure per se. And I was actually personally appointed by Mr Logan Roy? Can we call Tom? Tom um—
Last name?
His last— Weird, don’t think I ever, Tom, Boss Tom—? He’s in a relationship with my cousin, Shiv, Roy? Who’s my cousin? I mean I think that’s public knowledge. Although. Maybe, if you could keep that under your hat? Tom? Tom? Hey!
Okay. Greg? Greg Roy?
I’m actually a Hirsch, not a Roy. But my mom was a Roy. So, I’m basically a Roy in all but name. As it were.  
I’ll be two minutes, thanks.
No. No, Shiv— What?
It’s got weird, okay? I was over there and it’s gotten very weird.
How is he?
I don’t know, he might have put on a sock.
Well that’s good, right?
Or he might be lying there dead, I have no idea.
I can’t do this now, Shiv.
She thinks Marcia’s poisoning him.
I do not. Apparently, he doesn’t want to see us.
What, not including me?
Why would he say that?
Still pissed at you for not signing up to his corporate restructure? To make Marcia queen of the castle?
Well maybe  . Look did   see him over the weekend?
I heard he wasn’t up to seeing people?
No one’s seen him since we moved him home from the hospital on like Thursday?
Rome – you saw him, right?
Sure. For like five minutes. He was – he was pretty – you know, it wasn’t really ‘him’, him. There were tubes.
But after that? No one apart from Marcia has seen him for the better part of a week.
Four days is not a week.
Okay for the majority of the week. And we’re just accepting, the world is just accepting, this woman’s word that he put on a fucking sock?
We don’t want to rush the recovery.
Right, cos you like playing boss? Ken, we need to know what’s going on. Will you go over and see, please?
Should we take twenty?
Shiv, this is— I literally have something unmissable. Later, I’ll try later, okay?
Okay. Everything okay?
No, we’re on the brink of total corporate collapse.
Uh-huh. That figures. Call me if we go Lehman will you? I might like some of these chairs.
Hi, morning. Here to help fix the Death Star. ‘Grill on the exhaust vent, guys, grill on the exhaust vent!’
I’ve got your back. I told them this won’t be a habit.
My only concern would be, to brief this – meeting – is it a little – aggressive – for a temporary CEO?
That’s a good point?
Yeah well we’ve got a very aggressive drop in our share price, so I think that’s appropriate, good? So brief this wide and brief it fast, okay?
Good.
Great.
Good. And then I’ll be doing the Vaulter shoot and we’ll hopefully crystalize a new vibe, right?
Morning morning morning! Hey hey hey. My people. How’s it going? Great to see you all. You know my brother and I, CEO and COO? Gerri and Karolina?
Hey. I’m going to stand. Back. New trainer.
So. Just wanted to get the group together early in my tenure to say: Yo. You’re probably all wondering about my dad. He’s doing okay.
Yowch— .
We’re hoping for a full recovery.
He’s like a thousand percent better though. He’s like a bull in rhino hide.
Uh-huh. Slow and steady.
This morning he put on a sock. So.
That’s right. This morning he tried to put on a sock. And welcome to Tom Wambsgans who was managing resorts and is now sitting up with the grown-ups.
Hey—
So – what I want to discuss with you all this morning, is a new strategic vision. We have a great firm here. Multifaceted. Parks, cruises, et cetera. But at the heart, media: TV, movies, books and newspapers. And what we’re fighting for is eyeballs. Eyeballs we sell to, eyeballs we crate up and auction to advertizers. And bottom line: we’re losing. To monopolistic disruptors: Alphabet, Facebook.
Internet. Fucking game-changer, baby.
But we are still, just –   in a position to leverage our brands into something in the new landscape. But if we don’t, we’re gonna be like the biggest fucking horse trader in Detroit, 1909, okay? We need a more dynamic strategy – let’s call it, for the sake of clarity, the Strategy of a Thousand Lifeboats. Vaulter is a lifeboat. ATN Citizens is a lifeboat. There are no bad lifeboats.
VR could be a lifeboat?
VR’s a bubble. But yeah, no bad ideas.
Porn could be a lifeboat?
Except that. That’s a bad lifeboat. Hey – thanks, Rome. Look, this isn’t a brainstorm, all I’m saying: Everyone’s invited. I want all of you to be innovating, challenging, and bringing me a hundred lifeboats. Be bold, be disruptive! Okay? Because steady as she goes hits the iceberg?
Okay! Thanks, everybody! Woot woot!
He’s through there.
Hey Daniel. I understand you wanted to talk to me direct?
Yeah. It’s difficult with Joyce right now, so I thought this might be better.
Well, let’s get right to it, shall we? What happened? What do we say?
Okay, so I’ve been speaking to a friend who’s a lawyer and I’ve spoken to the PR people, at my publishers and I’m currently taking the view that I don’t want to comment as regards to anything.
Uh-huh. Fine. But between us, I don’t have time for a lot of – tofu. Was it your asshole online, were you looking to fuck around, what’s going on?
I’ve been advised not to say anything publicly.
Yeah but we’re not public and if this hack leaks Joyce is going to get fucked at a thousand miles an hour from every direction, so I need the facts?
The facts are – complicated and I can’t go into them right now. Everything isn’t as it seems. Is all I can say.
‘Everything isn’t as it seems’? That’s what I’m building my house on? What is that, your fucking Vegas magic show?
That’s it, for now, in terms of what I can say.
Okay well that’s a huge waste of my time, and I can’t speak for your wife but that’s a fucking treehouse of dildos right at the heart of this operation, so thanks a million and goodnight.
How’s your father? I was sorry to hear—
I have no fucking idea. Goodbye.
Great work, sir! Kudos! Here if you need a friendly ear, Lord Vader!
Just get shit moving at parks yeah, Tom? It’s stagnant. Shake that fucking tree, C3PO?
Shaking, bro! Shaking it big time!
Fiona— can you send flowers to Rava? Nice but, y’know, not ridiculous. They should smell like flowers, not desperation. And Fi, talk to Jess – I might want to throw a couple of items up on the internal – not a big deal, coupla TED Talks. And a documentary on the . First story. Because what are we, if not storytellers?
Hey, Captain.
Hey. And let’s get Carlo up in here. Those kitchens are a disaster. And maybe something fun. Not ping pong, but something, y’know. Throw some tags up in here. Not that. Skate park. Climb wall. None of these, right, but the essence? Talk to me.
Down three points.
Ugh. Okay.
There’s an AP headline: ‘CEO tells staff Waystar headed for iceberg’.
Not iceberg! Lifeboats! Lifeboats not iceberg. Jesus? Karolina?
That’s what we’re pushing.
The new regime shoot, Lawrence knows?
Yeah on that, ‘the new regime’? Forgive me for whoring in but shouldn’t I be in there as well?
Let’s not muddy it.
And in that equation, I’m the mud?
Okay, look I want to talk options to you, okay? I’ve got some thoughts that we’ve shared with Logan—
Interesting? Ideas that Dad didn’t want. Sounds appealing. But no, thanks.
Ken, these are modeled and thought through and—
And rejected. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m going for a walk, I need some perspective.
The thing about capitalism is, and I mean there are issues, but  . I mean this is a piece of shit chain on a stretch of nothing and this – this is like the most fucking delicious thing that anyone has ever tasted.
So, Stewy, listen, I could do with a read, from someone without a dog in the fight?
I wanted to ask you something too.
This is tight, this is absolutely just us okay? Because a leak kills me.
About Rava. For a pal.
Rava?
Yeah, it’s a mutual friend, and like, is it cool? Or are you still hankering for a wankering …  ?
I don’t have time for this – I mean, who, who’s asking? What?
I can’t say, but they wanted to know if it was an issue?
Like who? Fucking, Paul?
Fine, if you’re asking I’m assuming it is an issue.
Yeah well, look, we’re separated. Whatever. Free agents.
I get it. I’m having another. If you eat it fast enough you can actually burn off the calories. It’s a loophole.
So. When I took over, found out Dad took out a huge loan, a decade ago, secret, through the holding company?
Seriously?
Secured against the family’s stake in the public firm.
Oh fuck.
Yeah. Now the stock is getting ready to breach and the bank are—
Yeah I saw that price, brutal. Who’s the bank? Sounds like they have your dick strapped to the clapper of the opening bell.
I need a read.
Well, number one, you boost the price.
Uh-huh. Well I am trying. How’s it going to play for us to refinance elsewhere?
Honestly? Not great. ‘Why won’t your original bank step up?’ Not good. People don’t love the sector. They don’t love the firm, it’s ramshackle is the view, the fucking everything shop – and they don’t love— the situation. It’s tough.
Uh-huh.
Plus the options for sounding it out? Without word spreading? Horrible. Ugh. I’m so disgusting. One thing occurs, just blue-sky. Wouldn’t happen in a million years, but. What about we came in, my outfit, took the whole thing off the family’s hands?
Uh-huh? Well, obviously no, fuck off, how dare you, I’m so insulted, et cetera.
Of course. But you and Roman and Shiv. Do you all want to be in it, forever? You could all get fucking fucking, rich. Do anything. You can get into tech, Shiv can do consultancy,   Roman can, I don’t know, DJ for douchebags as they kill hookers in St Barts.
Uh-huh. Thanks. It’s Paul, right? Rava – it’s Paul?
Okay! I am open for business!
And can I get the senior team together tomorrow for a reorientation? I’m shaking the tree, folks! Excuse me, Greg, are you kidding?
Oh hey.
Greg, forgive me, but are we talking to each other on the poop deck of a majestic schooner? . No? Then why the fuck are you wearing a pair of deck shoes?
Oh, yeah? My credit card got maxed out? I’m living in a youth hostel
Jesus. How, squalid. Dude, are you carrying dogshit?
No, it’s – it’s free, right? Is that cool? I mean, I don’t want to be melodramatic but – my body is growing weak, due to – lack of sustenance.
But in a – dog-poop baggy?

Greg, that’s disgusting.
Not really. They don’t pre-poop them? They’re just bags, really. It’s just a mental barrier.
Pair of cap-toe Oxfords. Crockett & Jones. ASAP. Lucinda, can you figure out where we might put the talented Mr Greg? Flash! 
Can I get you to do a kind of a – a like an arm wrestle, on the top there?
So. How does it feel, man?
Feels pretty good.
Fastest falling stock on the exchange? One-three-four? Yeah?
Well, you know, I probably overpaid for you, so. Gonna hurt us.
I didn’t sign up for the toilet. I signed up for Logan Roy, major investment, global reach, not – Scrappy Doo and his thousand holey lifeboats.
Okay. Little cheesy? But ‘Vaulter’. How about, Kendall, would you like vault, like over Mr Yee here?
No.
No.
Fine. Okay. Then maybe just – bros? Hanging? Bros pose. Let’s go with the bros. ‘These are the bros who knows.’
I tell you what I wonder about you? Could you even open a restaurant? Could you actually fucking, do anything? Or are you just a name?
Good! How about another idea – ‘verbal gymnastics’? Can you give me a ‘business conversation pose’?
They got plenty. Make it work. Tell him to take thirty minutes’ worth of solo Lawrence shots and then delete them all.
Kendall. Sandy Furness is here.
What do you mean?
He’s here. In the building. In our offices.
The fuck? Who let him in?
Security wasn’t— And people were becoming aware … He’s been very nice to everyone.
He can’t do that. Fucking Pepsi doesn’t just drop in to see Coke. Put him where no one can see him. South Tank. I’ll be right there.
Sharks are circling.
How are we looking?
Down two more points.
Hey.
Hey. Nathaniel.
So. How’ve you been?
Busy.
Uh-huh. Right. So? Is this—?
It’s work.
Okay. Of course.
What?!
Fine. Just a simple work meeting on the bed of a four-star hotel room. If you don’t want a cookie, Shiv, don’t go down the cookie aisle?
It’s just private is all. The matter in hand.
Uh-huh, right? And, so how’s it going working with Joyce, the long glass of tepid water from Albany?
Good. How about you with that poor man’s Fidel Castro? The senior senator from the state of 1975.
Zing!
Look. I just wondered if you could do me a favor?
Do I owe you a favor?
Sure. Because I deigned to date you?
You  ?!
And I thought we were going to be friends?
Sure I want to be friends.
I wondered if you could run a background check on someone?
That seems like it might cause some ethical issues because there’s a world where my guy and your gal end up in the mud, wrestling for the democratic nomination and—
It’s not political.
Oh, right?
I need background on someone off the record. Marcia.
Marcia … the wicked stepmother?
Occurred to me a few years too late, I really don’t know much about her. Just due diligence. Okay?
Well, I do know a really horrible guy. And he’s incredibly expensive.
Well, thank you. That sounds perfect. Can it all go through you?
Uh-huh. ‘Yes my lady.’ ‘Deigned’? Have you  the women I dated after you?
Those women dated you   you dated me. It was like, ‘Oh I guess he must have   …’
Mr Furness! Kind of you to drop by.
Not at all. I just came to say how sorry I was to hear about your dad.
Really appreciate it. That’s kind.
I know we’ve had our battles but he was one of the great visionaries of his generation—
Well, it’s kind of you to do it in person when you could have just called, so. Thank you.
I hope I didn’t send the birds a-tweeting. What with all the uncertainty and whatnot.
We’ll make sure people know it’s just friendly.
Great. And will you give your dad my best? Tell him I dropped by?
Sure. Maybe when that news is a little less likely to kill him. Okay well I appreciate this, you’re looking great.
Thank you. I eat babies. And just to say, if I can give you any advice. I’m just watching the wheels nowadays so, you want to run anything by me, as an honest broker, use me. A mentor.
That is a very kind offer.
There’s probably a million options with our two firms? Swaps, acquisitions, cooperative interactions, smart stuff only a young man like you can conceive of.
Oh, Sandy, you’ve been pretty smart. Smarter than the regulators, anyway.
Tell you what was smart, Vaulter. I don’t care what the wise apples say.
Jess, would you take Mr Furness down.
Look at you. Right in the eye of the raging storm and cool as a cucumber. Stay strong. Stay in touch.
What happened?
He said I was dead in the water without him and tried to finger-bang me.
What did you say?
I told him I’d rather eat my own shit.
You heard?
What?
It’s over, bro. One-two-nine-point-eight. Clap hands, we’re fucked. I think if this was a movie, the office would now blow up.
You know sometimes you leave the party and you wonder what everyone’s saying about you?
With me it’s usually – ‘Who was that maniac who put a watermelon on his dick?’
I know. I know what they say about me. That. That’s how much people don’t trust me.
Hey, it’s me too, man. Don’t leave me out.
I mean the truth is – we, we call their bluff which may not be a bluff, and the debt becomes public and – we lose control. Or we get the stock up, which we – can’t, we can’t magic that. Or we pay the bank back. Which means – you know, to realize that much cash? Stock sell- down. Which is horrible. There are no good options.
Can I suggest something?
Uh-huh.
Can I suggest we all take our shirts off?
Umm? Ken?
You know I beat off in my office earlier?
You didn’t actually though?
You know, we can be a pair of little fucking worms wriggling around in here – do what the button-down fuckheads say. No offense, Gerri.
Please. Go ahead. Masturbate your way out of this.
Seriously, man. They could write an algorithm to run this place. But that’s not the answer. Break shit up. Disrupt. Yeah?
Ken? Tell him to put his shirt on.
I don’t fucking know. I don’t know. Okay. Look, so worst position, we sell down the stock. We survive.
Or. What about, next-wave shit. Prop-co op-co. Turn group finance into a profit centre?
Or go financial engineering. Full Enron?
Hey if you’re gonna shit on every idea, I got places I could be.
I mean to get some cash in the holding company – sell the old outdoor ads? And for the share price, parks and cruises?
Those are very profitable pieces of the jigsaw—
Poor Tom. Boo-hoo.
I mean sure but – what are we doing with them? Does that make a negative a positive?
Maybe we cut a title or two, from physical production. Newspaper- wise? Online only?
That’s a twenty-million solution to a billion-dollar problem.
But it’s the right direction of travel. That feels right.
Look, if you want stuff that will work for the price: lay-offs.
Yum yum, blood! See – shirt-off shit?
I guess it could be a package? Lay-offs, sell-offs.
Structured retreat?
Well, yeah, but with a philosophy?
I guess we should ask – or tell—
The sock-meister?
I mean we should at least  , right?
Could I just check – are these ironic at all?
Er, how do you mean?
I just— They look normal, but I’ve never— This isn’t my usual domain and I need them for normal so I just wanted to check, they aren’t ironical in any way or anything are they?
Hey, guys! Thank you so much for doing this here. I’m sorry. And – actually— can’t stay long.
Apparently goes for us too. Aunt Marcia won’t let us see Grandpa, right, kids?
Kendall!
Is he okay?
He’s improving. He’s really improving.
Great! Because I probably need to let him know something.
But he’s resting. I’m sorry. It’s not a good time.
Oh, okay – well, it’s just when my assistant called …  ?
She spoke with Joan, not me.
C’mon, kids.
Is this his request? The solitary confinement?
I’m absolutely guided by what he wants.
Well let him know, will you, I wanted to talk to him, keep him abreast of moves?
If you like you can tell me, and I’ll pass it on.
It’s complicated.
Oh. Of course. Over my head.
We’re – we’re retreating. Tactically, and—
I’m sure you’re doing the right thing.
She’s being protective.
Right. She probably has his brain in a jar and she’s working all night on his signature. For the new will. You get my flowers?
Tell Fiona, thank you.
Listen, how about you let the nanny take the kids.
Uh-huh …  ?
Come back to the old place and we probably need to—
Yeah—?
Y’know— negotiate.
You want to ‘negotiate’?
Yes. Like animals negotiate. Tough.
Have dinner with me? Tonight.
Hey buddy. Come on. First meeting with the senior management cadre.
Uh-huh? Great. Great stuff.
I’m gonna bad sheriff it, you cool to play the fuck-sock?
Uh-huh? As in? —
I was looking through employee emails, which by the way is completely legal, but does my breath smell? Honestly?
Er. No. No, I mean it smells of – breath but—
Too much drift in parks. Gotta shake that tree. I might punchbag you a little, that cool?
Oh sure. As in?
Morning, people. New day. Great to see you all. So, I’ve got a number of new approaches, that I’d like to run through. But first, some of you I know, some no, and I just want to get a feel for the team and let you get a feel for me? So, to kick off. Here’s a question. Here we are, off in the theme-park division, but tell me: If you could do anything, professionally, work anywhere, what would that be? — Yeah, go ahead. Can you intro?
Um, Brad Kilmartin, global marketing.
Hey Brad, good to meet you, man. So? Dream gig?
Um. I guess I’ve always wanted to work towards the creative sector in terms of— I could see myself, using my marketing skillset at a movie studio?
Sexy! I’m going to do you a favor, Brad. You’re fired. Follow the dream, man.
Heh. I mean—?
I’m sorry. This is the best division of the best company in the world. If you’re not happy, it’s probably best you move on. . If we aren’t feeling it, how can we get millions of American families to? Huh?
Are you serious? Jesus Christ?
So, now, you— Yeah ‘family man’? We all know why you’re here. You silver-spoon piece of shit?
Hey?
So, you bringing any ideas to the table or are you an empty fucking vessel?
Um – um. Ideas? Petting zoo?
Excuse me?
Like a scaled version, the biggest petting— It wouldn’t be pathetic,
Are you arguing from anecdotal? Because you better have numbers to back that up or I will tie your lanky limbs into a bow and turn you into a fuckable pretzel. Excuse me?
Okay, well, it’s hard. Well, I guess if Connor’s flying in?
He’s actually a pretty great guy.
So. Stewy. You know how everyone hates you?
Well, no. That’s not something I’m aware of, no.
Oh sure, they do. Private equity, getting your meat hooks in, chiseling your profit? Like a vampire locust fuck.
What is this? If I wanted to be insulted, I’d have coffee with my daughter.
I’ve had an idea. How about instead of taking us over, you give me four billion dollars? I stay boss. You stop raiding shitty companies for scraps. You  in a blue-chip corporation. One that is currently undervalued because of some unfounded concerns about its leadership, i.e. Little Lord Shareplunge here? The story twists. Happy ending.
Okay, full disclosure: I have a hangover. Bigger than normal. So, let’s do this the way we did back in the day – head into the boardroom with some something-something and bash out a few ideas?
Not for me.
Uh-huh. How would you feel if I …?
Really? Man?
What can I say. I’m Bacchus. I’m Type A.
Are you done?
No. Obviously – I don’t generally take minority stakes in public companies?
You’re a parasite. How about for once you make things bigger. With an old pal? Are you done?
Yes. I couldn’t begin to even think about this. But if I could. To sell it, I’d need it to be voting stock?
As long as the family maintain control.
Well, effective control. And I’d need a board seat.
I’d force it on you, dude. For the optics. Shit-hot new CEO has some hot-shit new money for investment? New generation. I keep the debt out of the news. Sisters are doing it for themselves?
I’m not necessarily totally opposed to this notion.
That’s right and luckily I speak Stewy. And that’s Stewy for ‘I have a raging hard-on for this.’
How much?
And listen, tell Paul to stick to jerking off at the opera. Rava’s still my wife.
You background-checked her?
No need to tell Ken.
Is that legal?
You don’t need to know—
I mean could anyone do that on … anyone?
First husband, you remember – Lebanese businessman. They had the high life in Paris, lot of parties, lot of pols and writers and also lot of slimeballs and fixers and shitbags and arms dealers. Oil guys—
And further back?
Further back is complicated. No leads.
Right. Is that—?
It’s weird.
It is apparently a little weird and there are two possibilities. Either, she came from kind of nowhere, Tripoli, Lebanon, turns up in Paris as a publishing assistant aged thirty-one and marries this guy, fine—
Or?
A clean-up job. Someone sometime tidied loose ends, did a deep- clean, bleached Google. Tied everything off.
Why would she do that?
Well – either, she didn’t, and you’re paranoid, or – there’s another possibility, and I don’t know what it is?
Hello. Hello, everybody?
Yeah, hi. You know Connor, Logan’s firstborn son.
Hi, Shiv, c’mon let’s …
And this is Tom, my, partner. And between them they are over twelve feet of we would like to see him please?
Good morning.
Are you going to force entry? Is that it?
Sorry I didn’t realize this would be framed so aggressively – I mean this is just normal. Let’s de-escalate?
He simply isn’t up to visitors.
Is this about me signing some pieces of paper or—
Shiv, please. It’s a very difficult—
Oh, the fucking waterworks now is it?
Siobhan?
I can’t believe you would try to stop me seeing my father!
I can’t believe you would try against his wishes!
Well it is nice to see you.
And how long are you in town?
I think she’s really upset but it comes out as anger. Pretty much everything comes out as anger with her. You look well at least.
She does look well. You also look well. Everyone looks well. Apart from Logan.
Dad—? How are you feeling? So, I wanted to come in. Um. Tom and I are engaged and—?
Where’s Frisk …?
The … You mean the dog?
Uh-huh? I love you.
I love you too, Dad. Mom took her to Italy. Yeah?
Everything okay?
Uh-huh. Thank you. He’s looking better.
The morning is not usually a good time. The morphine, he gets confused. He doesn’t want you all to see him when he’s not himself?
Uh-huh. Sure. He wasn’t himself.
No. And, Shiv—
Yes?
I’m a private person. Not all of us are born into good ease.
Right?
If you want to know anything about me, you can just ask me and I will tell you.
I just thought we were doing our plan, man. Shirts-off shit?
Retreat? Rome, this is a million times better, right? —
Good afternoon.
Thanks for making time for us, Mr Polk.
Not at all. And we’ve been looking at the terms we can offer and I think you’ve seen what we put together?
It’s a very brutal structure?
Well, these are the terms we think we can offer right now.
I mean the margin you’re making, you might even say you were— Well I mean blackmail is an ugly word. But so is getting goat-fucked.
I think we should keep things professional, don’t you?
Uh-huh. Sure. And professionally, we’re going to repay.
As in?
We’re good. Everything’s golden. We don’t need you. This can all stay private and I’ll be looking elsewhere for a banking partner as we go supersonic. Goodbye.
Um—
And fuck you.
I think, champagne for my friend?
Ken? I can have water with you.
No, it’s cool. I’ll taste it on your tongue later.
Bit creepy?
Not suave?
No. Nope. Have you been trying that a lot?
Oh, I thought that was— No wonder all the women I date keep throwing up in their soup.
So – is this the Stewy money we’re celebrating, I saw the news?
Well I’m not saying I’m the man but if there was a man, hypothetically, he might look a lot like me. I’ve solved the debt issue, with private equity money.
Well I’m very happy for you.
Yeah, well, the thing is, all of that, it’s made me think about – everything? And you know, here’s where I’m at: I love you.
Okay. Well. Thank you. Noted.
And – so—?
Ken?
C’mon?
Well, okay. I’m not sure I love you.
Yeah you do.
Fuck you!
Look. You want us to live separately, we don’t know why right now, but you say you do. Now that makes me unhappy. On the other hand, you claim – though of course I don’t believe you – that us being together will make you unhappy. So. One of us is going to be unhappy. I just don’t see why it has to be me?
Wow, I cannot argue with that logic. No, actually I can. Because it’s the argument of a psychopath.
At least let’s flip for it?
We are not breaking up.
We fucking are. I’ll do what I want.
Nope.
Yes.
B-man!
Nice office.
From up here, all the fucking ants, you can almost imagine they’re people, right?
So, you wanna work out down here or? We can parkour it or take my car to the park?
Well here’s the thing, Brex, I can’t run today because my back has been fucked since Monday.
‘Fucked’ how?
I assume you’re insured? I mean, I’m doing big shit, big big shit every day and so like losing even a quarter of a percent of my operating capacity, that has million- dollar implications. And I’m thinking, maybe, test case, I throw three or four dozen white-shoe lawyers at you and see what it would be like to actually physically destroy someone?
Dude. I don’t know what happened, but I’m sure I can fix it.
Fuck you – look at you, are you okay? No. I’m just saying, you need to take this seriously?
Sure. Look – what— It could be a trapped nerve but most likely it’s just a muscle pull. You want to lie down? I’m trained in deep tissue. Here.

4,"Fuck you!
Yeah?
Fuck you.
Yeah?
Fuck you!
Okay. I have to go.
What about Malaya, can’t she—?
Iverson will freak out.
Rava. Why don’t we just do it all. Back together?
Let’s talk later.
That was nice, right?
Nevertheless.
What? You know I’m clean.
Oh I know. Sure.
And everything else, that was just the rest of that?
Look. I don’t know. Maybe it’s seeing you doing so well at the— I don’t know, it’s like you’re moving on and that makes me feel okay about moving on too?
Hey, no. That’s bullshit. I’m not moving on. Rava? It all comes down to work and family. That’s all I want. That’s the secret sauce.
I got a lawyer. He’s nice. Let’s make it all really really nice, yeah?
Marcia. Everything alright?
Your father would like to see you.
It gives us options – I’m not going to finance you at the same levels as ATN – Lawrence, but it’s a start. The rest is up to you— It went to ATN already. Sorry, I gave them that— We’ll make it official soon enough.
Hey. Look at you. Sitting up. Fucking watching the news!
Huh. Getting better.
It’s good to see you. Probably your first bit of downtime since the womb, right? You understand, after you went down, the stock tanked. You should be flattered, I guess. We had some pretty shitty options. But I found us a private equity solution so. I tried consulting but— Karolina says there’s positive analyst noise. People like the shape of this. We’re at thirty-six percent. Effective control. Plus a war chest to make some moves. We’re – we’re in good shape, Dad. Keep getting better. I got this.
Yafuginidit.
Dad, can I get you something?
Okay, that’s right – along the edge. Good! That’s good!
Don’t patronize me. Walking’s not good. It’s fucking normal.
I’m not, that is good, Mr Logan!
I need a sit-down! Chair!
Come on. If you are not well enough for the charity dinner maybe I go with this handsome young man?
Okay and this is trickier, this is the proprioception.
Turn it off! It’s like being inside a fucking commercial.
You look good.
Uh-huh. Thank you.
Gracey? I’m trying to clean my fucking teeth here?
Did any more PRs get back about wearing my new pieces to the ball?
I don’t know. They’re not my fucking private army of little dollies I get to dress. I’ll chase, okay? This is why it doesn’t work when you stay over. There are five bathrooms. Why are you in this one? And now I want to fart and I’m not, I’m physically not farting because you’re here? I’m feeling kind of oppressed? —
So, I’m going to speak to Connor to confirm table arrangements? We’re hosting basically the same table as last year plus Joyce and Daniel, that okay?
I didn’t go last year, Shiv?
Yeah you did. Remember? Racist Belgian GS guy and his wife who tried to kill herself?
Shiv? I   I’d remember our first Roy Endowment Creative New York Ball together! I was crunching parks numbers like gravel granola?
Yeah?
Honey, growing up I used to look at the pictures of the RECNY in Mom’s old  s?
Uh-huh?
And now – a little boy from St Paul is going. With the most beautiful gal in the world!
Ugh. Fuck.
What is it?
It’s happened. It’s the inevitable asshole. Okay, where did you get it?
It’s quite a haunting image, isn’t it? The eye almost seems to follow you around the room?
What is this?
You know your future senator? Apparently, this is her husband’s asshole.
What? Fuck off. Can you prove that? How will you prove that? Do assholes have fingerprints?
He posted it himself. With the words, ‘Check out my asshole.’ On a website called Filthy Rich. For married people who want to fuck around.
Has everyone got it?
Um – just us I believe right now. Leak to ATN. My pal thought I’d be intrigued.
Okay, well, bring it on.
Umm feisty!
They’re not going to run with it?
Way below my level, Shiv. But my guess is, why not, a little? It’s dirty, it’s weird. And it’s evidence of precisely the sort of disgusting liberal metro butt-love that makes our viewership angry enough to buy pharmaceuticals.
It’s not even a story, Roman. Her  ? That’s— It’s unfair.
Oh it’s worse than that, Shiv, I’d say, it’s – it’s – malicious.
Days from a special election? I mean, we’re ahead but this could – this could have an effect.
Uh-huh. Would you actually say, it’s like we’re ‘partisan surrogates subverting the democractic process which underpins our whole way of life’.
Okay, well thanks for the heads-up and fuck you very much.
Yeah, well, I hate to be the bearer of bad news! —  – 
What do we call it? ‘An intimate body part’?
Sounds like his dick?
Or just – ‘his anus’?
‘Anus’ – at breakfast? That’s a juice-dropper. Lot of people gonna spill a lot of OJ.
‘A very private part of his body’?
Makes it sound like he has an internal VIP area. She needs to get more sleep. You sleeping okay, Karen? Yeah? You sleeping on your face? I’m kidding you look great.
How do I look?
F-I-E. Fuckable in an emergency, Mark. —
Hey, Rava? Did you make a decision yet? Well, no it’s not CEO arm-meat. Rava, this is a big night for me. I’m making Dad’s Wasp Trap speech. Fine. I just kind of assumed your ‘hopefully’ was a yes. Yes you said ‘hopefully’. I remember— I’m not trying to be anything. I know you, ‘hopefully’ implied a yes, you know what a big deal this is for the family but if you’ve changed your mind that’s cool just don’t try to tell me …
Just days before New York special senate election, Joyce Miller, the hotly tipped Democratic candidate, is red-faced this morning after the hack on blue-chip-affair website FilthyRich-dot-com. Not only was Miller’s husband apparently hunting for extramarital liaisons online, it appears he went on to share photos of a  . Now it’s seven-thirty a.m., Anna joins us with her Wall Street Breakdown.
Ugh.
Thanks, Karen. Yesterday’s market continued to move into positive territory. The S&P technology index led the way higher, up tw0-point- five-five percent. The index notched its best day in six months and is up nearly twenty percent on the year. The S&P 500 is having a harder time of it but still remains up seven percent on the year. Adding to positive sentiment was second-quarter GDP numbers that showed the US economy maintained a brisk pace of growth, at a two-point-eight percent annual rate, despite concern over a dip in the construction sector.
Connor, I’m just wondering if we should slide Joyce and Daniel and me off our table, and out of the front row, and the heat?
Well if I move Joyce plus two that’s a huge hole at table three. Right in the Chairman’s Golden Circle. Do you want a gaping hole there? It’s like having the front teeth knocked out of Waystar?
And she’s coming through the service entrance.
Can you put this in an email?
Can you write it down? I’m sorry, it’s a crisis day.
Yeah well I haven’t finalized the name for the signature cocktails, so I know how you feel!
Right and I don’t know if she’s bringing Daniel or— That seat’s in limbo. That’s a limbo seat, okay? I’ll confirm closer to the time.
It’s tomorrow, Shiv? You’re murdering me right now, you know that?
Listen, thanks for jumping on this whole thing. With Marcia busy with Dad.
Well that’s very kind of you to say. And it’s cool. No sweat whatsoever.
God help us! Right, Stephanie! What genius event planning are you going to dazzle me with today?
Okay, well I wanted to show you, this is how I would generally display the seating plan? —
Uh-huh. Good. No, I don’t like that at all.
Right? And this would be how we’ll set up for the step-and-repeat?
Yes, we’ll need to revisit all this. It doesn’t work for me. Nope. You know what Napoleon called Marshal Ney, Stephanie?
No.
‘The bravest of the brave’. The bravest of the brave. That’s what we have to be here, people!
How was LA?
Great. They’re all fucking nuts, but great. Can you get on to Lance about my speech? Can we get one of the late-night guys to cook me up a bit?
A bit?
A selection of jokes and riffs.
You’re going to do a joke?
What does that mean? I was fucking king of the  . Kicked their distribution into shape too.
Kendall, I’ve pushed everything this morning because—
Who’s that in my dad’s suite?
Because your dad wants to see you? I’m guessing you didn’t know?
No, I didn’t know. But— Great news. I’m delighted. Right? Did you know?
No but it’s great.
Oh sure. Shouldn’t he have told you? Listen, I’ll just get straight and go and see the old – fucking— Goat.
Tough morning?
Yup. Yes. A lot of things he told me were the case – about this – now the transcript of the messages has leaked. They were maybe not the case.
Uh-huh. Sure. Okay.
What’s everyone doing in there?
Um, just – basically, strategizing?
Fuck.
Ugh. You see—?
Oh. Urgh.
You’ve seen the annotated transcript?
It’s not a transcript it’s a chat log. Date stamp. IP address. Not much wiggle room.

Hey!
Uh-huh.
He’s let you down, Joyce. He’s a dog. He’s filth. He’s scum and I wish he was dead.
He’d actually like to come in later and say sorry to everyone?
Okay. Well, that would be nice?
Shiv? Shall we?
So, we need to issue a statement and as planned just move the conversation back to your issues.
I want to get into this. Why I’m getting this crap.
Sure, but just tracking the cycle for this, what people will be asking is: It’s an ass pic, is he gay?
He’s not gay. The full chat I think proves right, that, that he probably likes—
This is just for background.
He likes a finger up his – anus and that’s why he posted—
A straight finger – a hetero finger?
Yes.
Nothing else?
What do you mean—?
Anything else? In terms of what went up there? Any surprises? Because first it’s a finger, then it’s a fist, then it’s a dildo shaped like Richard Nixon?
Fuck this. A man wouldn’t get this. Let’s say that? Why can’t I say that? A straight white man’s wife does this, does he get hurt?
Agreed. But for us, now, this isn’t going away. I think you need to talk to your husband.
It isn’t going away because ATN won’t let it go away. So maybe you should talk to your father?
I don’t like ‘intimate body part’. Uh-huh. Your call, Eva. She tried to regulate every fucking sector in New York as AG, turns out she can’t regulate her own husband. If we don’t call out this frigid little – phony who will?
Hey, Dad! What’s all this?
I didn’t know you were coming in? Did Gerri?
Do I need permission?
Hey, screw you! You okay? Are you well enough to be in? Did you use the chair?
Chair?
The wheelchair, Dad.
Just making sure you weren’t selling any more of the company from under me.
Oh, you wanna get into that? You put a hole in us by taking on a shitload of debt, Pop? But – look, this is great to see you. So what’s the plan? Do you want to schedule a catch-up every so – often, so you can, you know, keep up to date?
You’re lining up acquisitions, is that right?
Good. Because, you know, things are cooking. Fucking, brave new world.
Cuh. Nothing new under the sun. I was informed, you’re doing my ball speech, is that correct?
I was told you suggested it?
Yeah I was told the mailman’s prick tasted of toffee apple, but I didn’t believe him.
What, you don’t want me to—
Good luck to you. The Sad Sack Wasp Trap. One time a year anyone fucking likes us. Knock yourself out.
You’ll be missed. We’ll raise a glass. You sure you’re okay? Why don’t you get a briefing and head home? Yeah?
Uh-huh.
Gerri?!
I need to take a leak. Where’s the guy?
You should have got the private bathroom put in.
Waste of money. And close the blinds in there. I’m not a fucking zoo animal to be watched.
So. Dad’s back.
Back where, what? Back in the chair?
Back to check in. I hope he’s okay. It’s fast, right? But good.
‘Good’? You’d love it if his brain fell out the back of his head!
Roman, Jesus, man, no. I’m just scared in case he—
You’re scared in case he’s going to push you out and your plans for you – know, Uber for news, Facebook for cats? Fucking open-plan office you on a dance platform jerking off idea gloop into – ‘think boxes’—
Got to go.
Roman.
Frank?
Good morning.
Well correction – it’s not a good morning from my POV because you’re here, and I hate you.
Oh, come on, kid.
What the fuck is going on?
Your dad asked me to come back.
The fucking, the – the Weasel Prevails. That would be a good name for your autobiography – if they did books by, jerks.
So I’ve come back.
You’re pathetic.
He apologized.
Sure, man. He didn’t apologize when he hit our au pair with a car.
He wants me to show you the ropes.
It was her fault, for being too short he said.
And here he comes. Bill. ‘The Best Boss That Ever Lived’. It’s like Mandela fucked Santa and he gave birth to  .
Have you heard about Logan? He came in apparently.
Uh-huh, I knew, but I couldn’t say. Come on, you genial old shitbag, get in here already, before it’s time for   to retire.
Tom. Sorry about all that.
No problem, Bill! I just hope I can eventually inspire similar affection. This is Greg. New guy I took under my wing when I started—
I’m actually—
He doesn’t need your life story, Greg.
So, thanks for everything. But listen, before I do the final photo. There’s a thing I need to mention. Just us.
So. Look, I’ve turned off the Wi-Fi, and this is air-gapped. I’m creating a Word document for you, and then I’m going to print it because I don’t want anything in my handwriting.
I think   been watching a few too many spy movies since they retired, eh, Bill?
Hahahaha! Yeah! Maybe! This is the number of a set of storage files in the depository. And they’re— The subject is— It’s something, that— It’s not a big deal. But it – it just needs to be handled. And you’re in the family. So, this – is the name of the legal office that is the intermediary? This is the person outside the firm we used as a firewall to deal with blowback on NDAs?
Uh-huh?
It’s   a big deal, Tom.
Right. But – what is it Bill?
Okay. Look, you’ve got two viable options. I can tell you everything, and that’s fine. Or, I can not tell you. And you can not know – and you stay clean out of the – death pit. And that’s fine too.
Uh-huh?
So, the nice news is, both ways, everything’s fine? Just keep the nuclear rods cool, and nothing’s going to blow.
Well that’s – that’s a really reassuring image, Bill.
Photographer’s ready …
Terrific! Thanks, Kelly!
Okay. You need to tell Dad to back the fuck off.
Hello? Did we have something scheduled?
He’s rehired Frank to babysit me and I don’t need a babysitter! Especially one I don’t get to fuck.
Seriously? Frank?
Yeah. I mean, you’re CEO, can he even do that?
It’s, I don’t— It’s a question.
You need to tell him to butt out. We’re running the show. Go back to bed, eat some soup. Get better.
Look. Relax. The dinosaur’s having one last roar at the meteor before it wipes him out. It’s, expected.
And what do I do with Frank?
I’ll talk to Frank. But, look, you’re doing a great job.
Thank you. Thank you. That’s good to hear. Because it’s a big job.
I know it, bro. Tell me about it.
If you want I could help you – we could tag-team it on Dad’s speech – at the Sad Sack Wasp Trap?
Um, I guess, I mean it is a CEO thing, so, I think maybe, I mean I have a whole thing prepared, with jokes and so—
You’re doing a joke? Fine. Who you taking?
No one. Rava’s busy.
Doesn’t want to.
So, I’ll probably— Maybe I’ll fly solo?
What? How does that look? CEO can’t get an ugly sister to go to the ball?
Sure. I’ll take something. A head on a stick. A cauliflower with lipstick. I mean know who I’d like to take? Anna Newman. From ATN?
Oh yeah, I’d fuck that in a minute. Ask her.
Not cool. I’m her boss.
What a pathetic beta-cuck. ‘Would it be “cool”? Cos I got something secret in my pants, would it be okay to show please, or is that a trigger-warning, baby?’
You’re a walking fucking lawsuit.
No. I’m honest, I’m just like, ‘Yeah I like your face, can I come on your face?’ which is why I am drowning in pussy and you’re not even fucking your wife. I’m sorry. Them’s the facts.
No thank you please leave me alone thank you!
So. Look, I want you to call off your dogs.
Uh-huh.
Because this obsession with Joyce – it’s out of line. It’s sitting very high in your half-hour.
Uh-huh?
And it’s vindictive and it’s – it’s actually it’s bad for democracy.
Uh-huh.
So? Are you going to respond?
I think it’s important to remember that I’m not the one taking pictures of my asshole here.
Are you running this because you think my dad likes this shit?
Oh he doesn’t put that kind of pressure on his people.
Look. Okay. We are where we are. If I could get you some nasty little tidbits on other folks I know, could you ramp this down?
We’re not the only ones running this. It’s a hugely popular story.
But you’re leading it, Eva. You had a ten-minute sexpert segment on how to keep your man happy in bed, on a  ?
Okay. You’ve said your piece and I’ve listened so—
No. I’m saying, as her strategist, this level of attack starts to reflect on your professional judgment and you should think about the future because this is the old world and things will change – in the world, one day.
You know I wouldn’t let any other strategist in the building let alone in my office?
Well, I’m very grateful.
So when we’re talking professional judgment? Good to bear in mind that only you’re here because your name matches the one carved on the building?
So, you’ve done this for a few old— vegetables?
And we step along, good—
Did you do Ollie Sirrett? After his?
I don’t really discuss that sort of thing.
Uh-huh. And how many of us go back to normal?
I like to think I can get you better and better every day.
Bullshit. Here’s a question. One to keep— lock. Can they test me? Can they, get a doctor in to see if I’m—
Impaired?
A sad case. Have you heard of that?
I’m a rehabilitation specialist, Mr Roy. Not a lawyer.
Morning? Personal first, then – the corporal.
Corporate? Um. Okay. Well, personal, nothing much. Pre-ball piece. We got profiles of endowment recipients and that’s all great? And one little
Say!
‘Kendall Roy will give the traditional address at the RECNY charity ball tonight in a sign that even after recovery from his stroke Logan Roy is intending to wind down from public duties.’
Where did they get that? Who gave them that?
I don’t know.
Well here’s an idea: Find out, or find some other prick to pay you a million a fucking year.
Handling the ball, it’s just not a big deal for me, that’s the thing that’s so nice. It is not a big deal.
Winding down. Winding fucking down? I’m winding up!
I had six hundred quail that were not sourced to my liking and I just had to make the call?
Uh-huh?
So I just did it. I trashed six hundred quail. No biggie. Sourced six hundred others. Done.
Uh-huh.
It’s just funny. Being in charge? Y’know when I think, how – years ago, I’d be at the table between you and Mom? And we’d look down and there’d be the mayor – and all the names of old New York and you’d whisper, in my ear – ‘that Astor used to be that and he ran this, till he snafued that and he’s porking her, she’s a slut and’ – it was just a – very lovely time.
Your mom loved all that. Fucking Wasp Trap.
What I was actually wondering about the Foundation, since I’m doing all this organizing, is would it be a good way in for me?
To?
To national affairs? Like maybe in your absence. I could do the speech – not Kendall?
I’ve jerked him around enough.
Or. Maybe— What would you think if I took over a little on the Foundation? Could we pivot it away from sick kids and contemporary dance towards tax reform and the abolition of the US postal service?
Uh-huh?
You know, to be frank, everyone’s dancing anyway, and a lot of charities cater for – sad sacks – and god knows I love them – but what about lending a hand to stimulate free enterprise.
Stewy is here – I’ve got him South Tank in case you want to keep it on the DL …?
Hey? So, why, Frank?
Oh, what no biggie. Why’d I come back? Thirty years he’s probably fired me forty times.
He never wrote the press release before?
I don’t know. Big house, Ken. Big mower. Mower needs gas.
Money? Any fuckhead can turn a few million a year, Frank.
Look. Here’s where I ended up. I could be humiliated in public – fired – or I could be humiliated in private and come back. I should have told him to fuck off but it’s my life. I’m kind of invested in the narrative? —
Kendall, I wondered if I could grab five—
Uh-huh?
Yeah it’s something – something you don’t know about and you maybe probably don’t want to know about?
You know what my dad used to say? He’d say he loved all his employees. But he particularly loved the guys who ate the shit for him and he never even knew it?
Got it. Then excuse me while I get myself a knife, a fork and a side salad.
Hey, man! So I heard your dad was back in?
Yup, he made it in. Which we were all delighted about—
And what’s the story?
No he’s great. Likes to remind us he’s still alive! Great to get his take. But he needs  . Dad? Hey. Just talking about you.
Uh-huh?
Mr Roy. Logan. It’s great to see you.
So you’re the little guy who owns such a big chunk of me?
Hahahaha.
Excuse me barging in. Just, Gerri told me you have a meet with Opalite Data later? Just to say, I like it, buy it. Okay, Ken?
Okay? Good thought. I’ll come find you and we can discuss.
Sure. But if I don’t see you. I want it.

I want us into data mining. Buy it.
Dad, it’s a really flooded sector. Lot of hustlers. Lots of bullshit. It’s a gold rush.
Yeah. And who wants gold? Make them an offer they get excited about. Make them an offer they tell their wives about that night.
Great outdated sexism, Dad, but I’m sure you’re all over the data mining.
Matched with an aged wife.
You okay. Dad, should I get someone? You shouldn’t be here, you know.
Fine. I just … need a piss.
Great, well thanks for sharing, old guy! Still recovering.
And like technically – without being too reductive, Ken, like, who is in charge, right now?
Me. I am. Legally and effectively.
Okay. Thank you, Rick. Thanks for that. Really useful.
So listen, Greg. It seems I have been exposed to a virus.
Oh, right?
It’s a deadly virus. And now I’m fucked, forever.
That sounds – bad?
It is bad. And I kind of need to share it – but anyone I talk to, I effectively kill. That’s the death pit, Greg. Take a look.
Right, I just don’t know if I’ll like it in the, the death pit?
You’re family.
It’s – complicated?
Kind of. But not really. For a number of years, there was an unofficial company policy on our cruise lines that if a serious criminal incident took place we would, if possible, sail not home, but to a Caribbean or South American port where there were, so to speak, ‘friendly authorities’ and we could minimize the incident to avoid negative PR.
Incidents like—?
Theft, sexual assault, rape, murder.
Uh-huh. The bad ones.
There’s hundreds here. Head of cruises himself, Lester used to go on ‘entertainment tours’ meeting the dancers and extending the contracts of the ones who’d suck him off. Everyone we could we paid off. But there’s emails, there’s correspondence. This could all blow. Who knows if the NDAs will hold— it’s a time bomb.
So what are you going to do?
I don’t know! And anyone I ask for advice, I make complicit. Because if you know about this, you should tell! But you can’t! Or you spread the virus!
Okay, Ken. Why don’t you grab the Opalite Data material and we can take a view?
Well as I explained, Dad, I think they’re kind of snake oil salesmen. They’re the people who – you buy a refrigerator and their algorithm is sending you thirty ads for more fridges? Great algo!
Yeah well, you’re the business genius who sold me out to this fucker, so I’d love Stewart’s thoughts.
I’ll get Jess to—
It’s thirty fucking seconds’ walk away, son?
Jess? Has anyone—?
Your dad popped in for like two minutes?
What the Jesus fuck!
So I think we’re buying. Good with you, Stewart?
You’re the boss.
All good? And, Stewy, you going to the Sad Sack Wasp Trap tonight?
He means the RECNY Ball.
Oh, sure, I’ll be there. Will I see you there?
Nah, I’m afraid—
I’ll be there. I thought I might as well go since I’m paying for it anyway.
You’re sure it was him?
You think a lot of people come in here and take a piss?
Maybe someone spilt something?
Yeah maybe the massive fucking ice sculpture I forgot about melted? It’s urine.
This isn’t a false flag is it? Did you piss on your own floor?
Why the fuck are you looking like that. What if people knew? Gerri, you have to talk to him.
What do you want me to say?
Well first, let him know where to go peepee and poopoo.
He came  . He was   to Stewy. I mean, what’s he going to do next? Start jizzing in my coffee? Take a dump on my iPad?
He’s still in recovery mode.
If he thinks he’s okay to come back, he should talk to you, Gerri, and the nominating committee and set a date, right?
Well, technically but I guess it’s a gray area because—
He says he’s coming tonight.
You’re kidding?
Okay, well that’s a concern, because obviously, with major investors and press on hand?
What if he freaks out? What if he falls asleep in his soup? What if he starts shouting – racist comments.
Just another Saturday night, baby.
We have a fiduciary duty not to let the company look – nuts?
And what did you do, Kendall – when he did this?
What did I do?
Yeah, how did you respond?
I – I didn’t want to humiliate him. We need a game plan. Frank? Gerri, you need to tell him, he’s sick, he can’t run the company. Yeah?
I just hope this seating plan holds. If it does, look out Middle East cos I can fix anything!
This would be the third shot I’ve given you in a month?
He feels he needs to be there.
You’re only meant to have three a year. No wonder you’re not sleeping. You’re risking long-term nerve damage and—
Jab. Not jabber. Shut up and shoot up.
Now this is just a nice offer vis-à-vis the event tonight, if any jewelry at all catches your eye this is all designed by Grace O’Hare, exciting new designer, and it’s just a complimentary offer via our PRs to wear anything that works for you to the RECNY Ball tonight. Come on, pick something and let’s get going … It all suits you. Everything suits you. Just take some.
Sweetheart? Can I talk to you for a minute? I could really do with some advice. Have you got time?
Uh-huh.
So, look, I don’t want to get you into all this but – well, Bill told me as part of the handover – where some of the bodies are buried? But they’re not very well-buried bodies. And they’re not really bodies. They’re zombies, that might rise up from the dead at any moment. And kill me.
As in—?
I don’t— Maybe you don’t want to know?
Uh-huh?
But I’m worried if it does comes out – and it’s kind of bound to come out – and it’s, while I’m in charge – I’m dead. Because I know and I’m not doing anything. But if I do do something, I’ll have to, you know, do something? I’d like to, not carry the can, obviously, but also do the right thing? Maybe?
And what’s the right thing?
What I’m thinking is, as soon as possible, a press conference. Get everyone in – tell all the top execs and law guys. And we go public. Outside investigation. Disinfectant of sunlight. Pin the rap on a tight group of naughty, rotten apples?
Sounds brave.
Uh-huh. Right. And that’s – good?
Look, can we circle back? I need to talk to Joyce.
So, I missed your call, what’s the news?
Yeah. Look, I know it feels huge to us but it started the day as item three, end of day, I think it will be item five.
They’re not going to drop it?
I can’t stop it. Your husband’s asshole is the gift that just keeps on shitting. We just have to hunker down, keep focussed, ride the cycle.
Or, other option, I go after them?
I don’t think that’s a good play.
Is that you saying that as you? Or as the daughter of a media mogul?
It’s me saying that.
Uh-huh. And so – how can we – how can we stop this?
Well – definite end, just as a fact, to kill this for now and ‘the future’ is if you leave him?
Uh-huh? Okay.
But I can’t advise on that? So, see you – both – later?
Yeah. Looking forward to it.
I don’t know if I can do this.
You can.   Fuck them.
Excuse me, what the hell is this?
A glass?
Every glass should be at three o’clock.   is nothing.  is something. Check every glass! Unbelievable.
Why is no one standing in that half of the room?
Oh god. The room is growing lopsided! Let’s lead them – like sheep. Willa – lead them over, corral them!
Hey, guys – there’s plenty of room over here.
Come and enjoy the space, guys! Acres!
The signature cocktail is too avant-garde! The servers are creating bottlenecks! They put pesto in the gin! It’s a disaster! There’s no flow! The evening is congealing, Stephanie! There’s no flow!
Yeah my dad’s first wife thought she was gonna, you know, empty the ghettos and get everyone into ballet when they started this thing. So patronizing.
Heh, right.
A couple of kids who got into New York City Ballet still send us cards at Christmas though so I guess that’s nice or whatever?
Wow, that’s nice.
Yeah it’s dumb, but it’s cool.
Okay, change of plan. We’re going in the front.
So how many presidents you had in this contraption, buddy?
Three, sir. Two former, one serving.
Who’d you like?
I heard good things of them all, sir.
Uh-huh, very fucking diplomatic.
I was going to use the, ahem, back entrance but I thought, maybe not tonight?
Good. Good. Good. Is that too wry? About our good works? I mean is it, like, snitty?
Well there’s all this? Like three pages of – about you, and the family, and the good works and the big hearts, and on and   and  .
Excusing you but I didn’t ask for editorial comment— And then it’s into Kendall. Okay. And he’s all blah blah blah – hold on, pal. What’s that? ‘Surprise Logan retirement announcement’??
Yeah that came through late. He said he’d freelance that?
Where you sitting, Greg? In the basement? Or out by the dumpsters? Tell me you’re at least in this time zone?
Hey! Tom, so, look, I hear you’re thinking about holding a little press conference?
You know about that—?
I don’t know anything.
Right, it’s just I think—
Tom, you need to shut up. This isn’t the time to get your conscience out and shout ‘Oooh, look at me, I cannot tell a lie, I’m a good little boy, look at my ding-dong.’ Okay?
I don’t think that’s a fair characterization of—
Do you know who the sin-cake eater was?
Um, no—?
He’d come to the funeral, and he’d eat the little cakes they laid out on the corpse, he ate up all the sins, and you know what, the sin-cake eater was well paid, and so long as there was another one who came along when he died, everything worked out. So this may not be the best situation but there are harder jobs. And you get a fuckload of cake.
And can I ask where you heard about this?
Tom, it’s tough to have to tell you this way but I’m in a sexual relationship with your mother. And she talks in her sleep.
Hey, Dad? Dad?
Ugh?
How you going? Yeah. Just wanted to check in on something? Just to check you were – aware of Kendall announcing your retirement this evening, I mean I’m sure you were but I wanted to triple-check?
What?
Yeah, is that – right?
No.
No? Is it a mistake? Cos Kendall’s going to read it, it’s on the teleprompter.
Change of plan. Kendall’s not speaking. I’m speaking.
The butter’s too cold! The butter’s all fucked, you’re fuckwads and you’ve fucked it! There are rolls ripping apart out there as we speak. It’s like granite! I’m a laughing stock!
Connor, there are always some issues when you serve this many people but I think, on the whole, it’s going very well.
Complacent! You’re fired!
Hey, you lump of fucking turducken.
Hi, Tom?
Did you squeal?
What?
Did you bitch me out, pig-man?
As in?
You bleated – about the press conference?
No.
Yes you did.
No I did not.
Yes you did, you filthy piece of shit. I should drag you into the kitchen and have them boil you until you’re sterile— Oh my god, Greg, did you just touch me?
Tom, I’m sorry but your spittle was actually like—
This is extraordinary. What are we going to do about this? Are these assaults going to be ongoing?
No.
And you’re telling me you didn’t do it?
I promise. I swear to god.
Then who the fuck did, Greg? Ah? Because I only told you?
Dad, I don’t want to shit-talk Kendall. ‘He’s not up to the job’— but I think I speak for everyone when I say it’s great to see you back.
Thanks, son.
But – one thing, and I don’t mind, it’s fine. But I wanted to say – Frank is what to me now?
He’s – Vice Chairman and your general advisor.
But why?
Why? What’s the situation with the park numbers?
How do you mean—?
Attendance is good but occupied-room nights are down on last year. Why?
Well, I’ll press Tom? What? I’ve been waiting for Tom to get his feet fully under the table — The guy is a bit of a flake is the truth. But leave it with me. When are you coming back in again?
You need to soak up Frank’s experience.
Uh-huh, but what does that mean?
It means do what he fucking tells you.
So sorry about the butter, guys.
Nice one, bro.
What?
Fucking the talent?
Hey, come on, what?
ATN are fucking me, you’re fucking ATN. It’s a literal fucking clusterfuck.
Everything okay?
Yes. I’m having a lovely time, thanks.
Is there anything I can do to put you at ease?
I’m having a wonderful time, really.
And you’d tell me if you weren’t?
I’m a reporter, I report. Absolutely.
So sorry about the butter.
What?
And just so you know, apparently, Dad’s going to do the speech, so late change of plan. Hope that’s ‘cool’?
Excuse me?
Yeah he just said. So. I guess that’s put a spoke in quite a few wheels!
Con. He’s in no fit state. Is he okay? I mean this could be, does he know where he is?
Oh he knows. Uh-huh.
There’s like, pension funds, there’s analysts, there’s major investors. This is fucking high-risk. Gerri?!
Dad wants to talk? Gerri?!
Okay. I did not know that.
When he opens his mouth anything could come out. Drool, anti- Semitism, fucking silk handkerchiefs tied together. If he fucks up publicly we have a major problem. You need to talk to him.
You good?
I’m good.
Great. Good luck tonight. You’re gonna knock it out of the park.
Thank you.
Hi, don’t mean to intrude? Hold on, buddy. Thanks?
It’s still early, Rome?
Well thank you, Grace, you delightful speaking timepiece.
Dude, if you like her that much why don’t you ask for her fucking number?
Rome?
You clearly want to, right? Do you want to give him your number?
Yeah I want to give him my number.
Dude, ask for her fucking number?
Can I – get your number?
Okay! Here we go! Okay? Thank you, everyone’s happy!
Good luck. Bon chance! Best foot forward. You can do it! Good luck. Nervous?
Not too bad.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I had a thing, with the butter. But, seems to be okay. Where you from?
Er Bushwick?
Indeed. Yes indeed. Well, wonderful. Great effort. Connor Roy. People have a lot of preconceptions about me too. It’s difficult, I mean, not like— I imagine everything is for you but—
Right.
I actually have an idea that social equality could be effected by a total eradication of federal support. Just people like you and I, doing it together, fighting it out, without, all the – bullshit, that’s holding you back. You know?
Okay. This is me.
Great. Break a leg, my friend!
So I’m sorry to hear your friend was getting crucified all day?
Oh you heard that? I’m surprised you heard that, given that it had so little to do with you.
Good job tonight, Con! Best event of the fall.
Terrific evening. You really showed it to those cystic fibrosis fuckheads.
It’s all about the charity, not about me, folks.
We fucking nailed it! Everyone! You’re all amazing and I love you! Stephanie. My rock. We did it. We just landed this thing on the Hudson.
Ladies and gentlemen. It gives me   pleasure to introduce to you, on this most auspicious of occasions— In a change to advertized attractions. The man, the legend, Logan Roy!
You okay? Keep going. Just get to Dan. Then pretend to talk.
Oooh! Elvis! I thought we were getting the support act! He’s kind of milking the walk?
There’s forty billion dollars of market cap waiting to see if he can make it. What? If he falls, I could lose several of my houses .
Now? Come on. Come on! Nearly there.
He’s retiring? He’s a lizard?
I’m officially announcing … I’m back. You better believe, I’m back! Full time. Better than ever!
Great news! Right.
It’s great.
Get me out of here!
And what was that?
Went well, I thought.
What the fuck is wrong with you, Dad?
I see you. I spied you fucking out, son. Don’t try that again.
I have no fucking idea what you—
Retire me? Shoot me like a dog in the street. I heard about your little speech?
What do you— I was going to do one fucking joke about how you’d never retire?
Bullshit.
Why didn’t you just talk to me? I’ve no idea where this has come from, Dad?
Huh.
You’re okay, Dad. You’re okay.
You did well tonight … Connor. I’m proud of you.
You know. You pull off a night like this and you realize, people are just people.
Uh-huh?
‘I can no longer obey,’ Dad. ‘I have tasted command and I cannot give it up.’ A certain artillery cadet by the name of N. Bonaparte?
There you are!
Hail to the chief, Dad?
Hey. So look, Anna. Can I just ask? Is there – something – going on here?
As in?
Like, I don’t know, is there – an atmosphere, did I say something to offend you?
This has been a lovely evening. I was so glad to come.
Uh-huh. Thank you. So am I crazy? I feel like I’m on a date with an app, like there’s invisible bubble wrap?
Look. Off the record? Off-off? You seem like a nice guy. Eva told me to come.
Well asked. I asked her to just, ask your people.
It’s fine. I’m just seeing someone. But you’re the boss.
What? No I’m not that guy? Okay?
Yeah. Sure, no. I mean you actually are that guy, right now but – sure.
What did she say, Eva?
Nothing. To make sure you had a ‘really good time’.
Was she joking?
Eva? Oh sure. Okay? And I’d prefer it if you didn’t say anything?

Please don’t. Okay?
Sure.
Dude? This is our charity. How much a plate? You’ve got to get at least a blowjob. That’s the law.
That’s not the law.
Well it’s the ethical code. I hate to say this, but she has behaved rather unethically here.
We might be looking for a new Wall Street correspondent.
Good kid. Smart move. Keep talking.
I aim to please, ma’am.
Hey, Shiv. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Well I’m glad you thought it went well. I’m glad Twitter is so positive about the joke. No I’m sure it was a great evening. You did great. Everything is great. Her opinion is we’re okay.
Oh great, well in that case I’ll sleep soundly tonight. I mean it is only an opinion and you know the thing about opinions? Everyone’s got one. In that respect they’re like—
God. AP photos. Some people just don’t know how to wear jewelry.
Did you tell him to call?
Well, you did it.
Hey hey hey!
Uh-huh uh-huh. You’re late.
Well, like ten minutes, Grandpa? Happy Thanksgiving!
