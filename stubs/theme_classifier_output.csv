And Doderick is?
Doderick is mild-mannered to a fault. Puppyish in my enthusiasms. Playful, eager and lacking in guile. I am the best friend to all I meet.
Okay. Let’s go, folks!
Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens and Staten From the Battery to the tip of Manhattan Asian, Middle Eastern and Latin, Black, White, New York, you make it happen! Apologies, Fikret.
Yeah? Hey hey hey, man! Good to see you. So. Where are we? Are we ready to fuck or what?
Yeah. Okay. Look. I’m really sorry. But it looks like there’s an issue.
How do you mean, dude? I’m here?
Yeah I’m sorry, but we’ve been looking at the offer, while you were in transit, I mean really looking at it.
What, before you didn’t have your glasses on? You were smelling it? Huh? I got the call.
I’m sorry, but it won’t fly – with my board.
I was told it did?
Yeah well it won’t. Not this actual number.
I came all the way down here, dude?
Well, I’m sorry, ‘dude’.
You know I love what you do. That’s been made clear? I’d love to keep you and your team in place, Lawrence? I love Vaulter.
Sure. I just think bottom line, I can deliver a lot more value for our shareholders. Hope I haven’t inconvenienced you?
I see you. I see this.
We’re grateful for your interest in our little outfit, but I think that’s it.
You got the message? I am not letting you Neanderthals in to rape my company. Ever. You’re a bunch of bloated dinosaurs who didn’t even notice the monkeys swinging by till yesterday. Well fuck you, daddy’s boy.
Oh what? Please.
I’ve got a track record from founding one of the most exciting new- media brands in the world. What have you got? Track marks from shooting junk? Thanks for coming down. Great to meet you. Sorry this isn’t going to work out.
It’s going to work out.
No it isn’t.
What the fuck? Frank. How did this happen? How can we sweeten this?
You still want to pursue it?
Of course I want to pursue. I want to announce. This is part of the whole thing. Our offer is fucking good right?
You want to bump the offer another point? You wanna call your dad?
Do I want to call my dad? No I don’t want to call my dad. Do you want to call your dad?
No.
Does anyone want to call their dad? No one wants to talk to a dad. Good. Okay, so, we’ve started so let’s buy this fucking company? I’m pushing the bid to one-twenty. Okay?
Okay.
How’s it going? Did you close?
I’m right in the middle, Dad. Yes it’s okay! We’re not quite closed. I’m going to one-twenty. So that’s good. And are we still on for the announcement?
Uh-huh.
Great, cos obviously I’m soft floating to like Frank and Rava? And there’s obviously gossip getting soft floated.
By who?
By the ether. I don’t know. Well look, happy birthday, old geezer! It’s exciting. This is going to be great for you, Dad.
I’m excited. Marcy! I thought this whole place was going to be ready? Have they fucked us on the internet because—? My emails— I’m going to call, Ellison or Gates because my emails are— Pencil! Where’s a—?
I think it’s all up, Logan?
I’m not getting anything. Who do they think I am? Uncle Fuck. It’s not working, I’m not paying until—
I think maybe you just didn’t get an email for like ten minutes?
Uh-huh. Okay. He’s started floating. That wasn’t the arrangement. He’s offering one- twenty. He’s got a hard-on. You don’t walk around with a hard-on. Makes you look ridiculous. Get it trapped in the eye of the fucking Halloween pumpkin.
But the me thing? You’re okay on the me thing?
I’m on it, Marcia, don’t worry.
I mean not that I mind?
I do.
This is going to be great for us though. Did you see the brochure I sent? The Galapagos thing?
Oh, yeah? Great. Turtles, all kinds of disgusting shit. Terrific.
A lot more cards? Presidents, prime ministers, royal crests.
Just have Jan log them— so I can see which fuckers have dropped me already. Marcia—
What?
Look I’m not about to spill my guts like some queer. But you know.
Thank you. I love you too.
I’ll be back by Sunday night so I’ll look at his speech with him then, okay?
Okay but his office wants the poll numbers by the prekend.
By the ‘prekend’? What the fuck’s the prekend?
The prekend is Friday.
If he wants them by Friday can he not say Friday?
Thursday lunch to Friday p.m. is the prekend.
Fine. Get Rennie to put them together. Okay?
Ugh. This is a fucking disaster. Shiv? Can you— I need to strategize my gift? What can I give him he’ll  ?
I don’t know, my dad doesn’t really like – things.
He doesn’t like ‘things’?
Not really, no.
Ugh! It needs to say, I respect you, but I’m not awed by you. Start a fresh chapter. What says that?
A pen.
A pen?
Tom, every gift he gets will mean an equal amount of nothing to him. Just make sure it looks like ten to fifteen grand’s worth and you’re good.
Ewwww! He’s puking out of his  !
Fuck  .
Protein spill. Head stays on! Head stays on!
Greg? Are you okay? How’s it going?
Going great.
Uh-huh, so why are you calling me at six-thirty in the morning?
Yeah, great but also – Mom, sorry but I screwed up. Well not me – but look, a, a – kid smoked a joint in my car.
‘A kid’?
Uh-huh?
And so, if you can believe it, the car smelt like skunk weed, and I guess I smelt like – well you can see from there, how I got implicated in this kind of tragic misunderstanding?
Did you – tell them – who you are?
No. No. I thought – no. I didn’t want to be an asshole. Or – get into it all. I don’t know. I liked it. I’m sorry, Mom, I’m such a fucking screw-up!
Okay. Listen to me, here’s what you’re going to do—
Okay. Uh-huh.
What? What do they say to one-twenty?
They’re not going to budge unless it gets to be a stupid number.
What’s a stupid number?
What’s a stupid number? A badillion? I don’t know.
Because one-twenty is stupid.
Look, I think this is clearly about Lawrence. Should we look at his package?
Okay. Who’s this? Is this news?
Hi, Kendall Roy?
Hello?
I was sent by – Roman. To burn some sage?
Excuse me?
It’s auspicious? I’m a business alchemist. It’s a gift, from your brother.
Will it set off the smoke alarms?
Not usually.
‘Not  ’?
Yeah, we’re looking at a billion-dollar acquisition so I think we’ll need a little more reassurance before we break it up with a building evacuation?
Hey hey hey, motherfuckers!
Roman.
My guy? Are you saging?
We’re just concerned about the alarm?
Right, bad juju. Maybe you should make a move, dude?
I can use essential oils?
I think just fuck off thanks. How’s it going?
Good. Just finessing. You okay, man?
Of course I’m okay. Obviously I’m okay. Why do you ask? What here? Oh, man, I’m so over all this. I was a bad fit. I was never a corporate cock-suck anyway. Besides. I never got this high in the fucking building! They stuck me in LA with Old Father Time, we were the pool boys, right, Frank. Fucking banana cabana? So. What’s the bid?
Well—
What that’s ‘commercially sensitive’ – I’m still on the board, bro!
Going one-twenty-five.
One-twenty-five! Fuck!?
What? High or low?
Whatever! For Vaulter? Bit of content and a brand name? Your funeral. You’ll be captain soon enough. Oh c’mon, every intern on the Street knows you’re stepping up. Congrats, man, congrats. So pleased to be out. The company was essentially a cage to me. Well, congrats. I ought to head. Look at all this fucking bullshit!
Marcy, I’m heading out, as ordered.
Great, till one should be—
Fine – but just here – yeah? I don’t want to get a fucking heart attack from the surprise. Have them here. And not too loud. Just – a—
You want me to email you the exact details of the surprise?
Dad?
How’s it going?
Fine. Good. Why are you—? Are we okay?
Oh yeah. Yeah. I just have some paperwork—
Ahead of the announcement?
For putting Marcy on the trust. Just bullshit. But I felt like checking in.
Oh. Because on my announcement, what’s the precise timing on that?
Let’s see how this goes and I can lay it out.
Okay? So this is just the trust? It doesn’t affect me stepping up?
Nuh. I think I told you about—
Dad – I’m busy, do I need to lawyer all this?
It’s housekeeping.
Fine. Marcy’s fine by me. I mean the others, might not feel the same?
I’ll deal with that. Okay. So – I’ll see you in—?
Yeah look, Dad, on lunch. I really want to be with you but the deal—
If you need to stay, you need to stay.
I really want to be with you?
I appreciate it.
It’s just, delicate. I mean they can handle it but—
. Any indication. Call me. Okay? And look, this is gonna get press-released, but – by tonight I’m going to be Chief Exec of Waystar. . I just wanted you lowlifes to be amongst the first to know, okay?
Congratulations.
Thank you. Okay. That leaks, you’re all fucking fired! Off we go let the trumpets blow Because the driver of the mission is a pro. The ruler’s back!
Okay, guys – can we back off, private event? Freelance? Could be getting colder out there, boys. Mr Roy. Logan, you going today? Is that right?
Fuck off.
Hi. Hello there!
Can I help you, sir?
I’m actually – I’m here to see you!
Can I see some ID?
I’m Greg? Marianne’s Greg? Your nephew? My mom called Marcia and I heard – I checked with the – the man and he called up and said it was all okay—
Oh. Right. I didn’t know you were coming?
Yeah I’m— I think you did?

I’m on my own. I hope it’s okay. I wanted to say, many happy returns.
Thank you. You okay?
Oh fine! Seriously, fine. I get it. I could have been anyone. An assassin. You could be dead now, or dying. But – yeah. Happy birthday!
Hey, Global Tom! How you shaking? You still fucking shit up for us?
Ha! Still tidying up your mess, pal!
Sis. The pols still boring the living shit out of you?
Yeah, you know, still burying the bodies and counting the cash.
Ha! Look at you. Walking around like you’re an actual human person!
You smell good. What is that? Date Rape by Calvin Klein?
Yeah you wish!
‘You wish’?
Okay! He’s back! Folks, he’s back! Can we – can you find somewhere?
It’s – a long way up.
Ah?
It’s— We’re going up?
Uh-huh.
So great to be here. I thought you would have known. I hope it’s okay?
Sure. Good to see you.
I actually came because, I needed to ask something?
Uh?
Yeah um, I actually I think you know but I had some help, and I got on to the international management-training program? The theme- park tour? And – and – I was very into it? But I got sick. Out of – actually – out of Doderick’s eyeholes and—
Great. Excellent. Wonderful. Okay, give me some room? Connor, Primo! How are you?
Good. Excellent, Pa. Here you go.
Roman, Romulus! Look at you, you look fantastic!
Happy birthday, Dad.
Siobhan. Sweetheart. Is Tom here?
Uh-huh. Yup.
Oh well, never mind. This is Craig, everyone, by the way. Cousin Craig.
‘Craig’? It’s Greg. No?
Yeah. Greg. Greg. People have mistakenly called me Craig in the past so I answer to both.
Here. It’s just a token of my very real and enduring admiration and the hope that a new dawn might—
Kendall? You came.
Hey. Big day. Congratulations. You bastard.
Congratulations. Good luck.
So, what’s the news?
Okay. I’m just gonna—?
Okay, we’re good. Talk to me— Is there word? You’re on speakerphone.
PPG Bank have got their nose in, might be rustling up another bid.
Ugh. Shit on my dick.
O-kay! Now the fucking’s started!   you’re getting fucked!
I’ll call you back. Just a few final issues with the acquisition.
PPG are balls deep in him. Hustling up a rival bid.
Okay!?
It’s under control.
You know, I think the only thing worse for us than buying that piece of shit would be trying and losing.
Fuck off.
Well that’s unnecessary!
You want the rival bid to go away? Banks are whores. Pay them and they’ll fuck anything. So cut them in on our financing and—
Well, no because, there are rules—
Yeah the rules are for the – the people who like rules—
Are you getting played, Ken?
Am I getting played? No I’m not getting played. I’m the puppet master. I’m all over this, like fucking – mayo. Now look, can we please clear the room please? Thank you. I’ll be out, yeah? Thanks, guys. Great input.
People need to know you’re the boss, Ken?
Uh-huh. I know it.
This is your day. And not because he said eighty was retirement in some interview ten years ago. Because you deserve it. You did the MBA, you did the hard yards. China. But you might just need to push it over the finish line?
I’m not losing this deal. We call PPG, offer to cut them in on the financing, if they make the other bid fuck off. Okay? It’s Logan’s idea.
Great idea, Ken. Right idea.
Thank you. You are able to do anything. You are a master of the seas. If your final destination has been correctly determined, then all apparent diversions are but waymarkers of your route.
So, I brought you this. Happy birthday.
Oh. Thank you. This is? These are nice. These are nice houses – where is that?
That’s Vancouver?
I like Vancouver.
That’s our old house, Dad. These are all our old houses? LA, yeah? Montreal. London?
Wow. The paper is very thick.
Yeah. You like it?
Oh sure. Great. This is— a quality item. I want to look at this properly later. So, go on, give me five. What’s the news. What’s happening?
Good. Yeah. I want to talk to you about Tom. He thinks maybe he might be ready for the parks, you know globally and—
Look, Dad, we should get this somewhere ambient. You want to—?
Connor. How you going? How’s the ranch?
Perfect. Light pollution is like zero so, that’s nice, you know.
Wonderful. What the hell is it?
It’s a – goo? Is it goo?
Perfect.
Sourdough starter.
.
I thought you might enjoy making something?
Uh-huh? Right?
Fine. Forget it. I just thought you might like it?
I do. I just don’t know what the fuck it is.
It’s sourdough starter. To make bread, without yeast? The old way?
Oh, okay. Old bread. Thank you. How are we looking?
I’ll keep you posted. Look, Dad, I just checked with Frank and the holidays mean the board might be hard to get together and it’s all over the web, so I’ve scheduled a call for four? Then we can issue the release?
Uh-huh. You did?
Yeah. Is that okay?
You go on. I’m not going.
Sorry we’re late.
No worries. You’re not even. Twenty is margin of error.
And I got your message. That’s fine.
Yeah? It’s just as it all goes through – next two weekends will be crazy. But then – once it’s done, it would be great if—
It’s fine. Bank the weekends – spend them later.
I don’t want to fuck things up though. I can come up to you? And then – if you want we could grab dinner for the handover?
What like – two weekends. Ummm?
No? . Are you seeing someone?
Yeah. I am. And I’m just hoping this one won’t leave coke smeared all over the kids’ iPads?
Uh-huh. No. Fine. Yeah.
Kendall, it’s okay. I’m fucking around. You’re good. Coronation day. You deserve it. Seriously. After everything. And I think you’re going to be able to cope with this.
Well, obviously I’m going to be able to cope with this.
Exactly. I know.
Are we okay? Lunch in ten.
Hey, okay, listen, just two minutes before lunch? Kids. Can I get you, for two minutes?
Oooh a speech!
Er Uncle Logan could I get—?
Not now.
Sorry. I need your attention. About the— What I was saying, about the management-training program? I need to get back in.
You’re out?
Yeah. I got, there was an issue – and so my grandfather said to come and talk and—
I’ll do anything for my brother.
Oh that’s – that’s nice and, I’m really going to give this one hundred percent and I would love to be able to move up and—
He just needs to ask.
Oh. My grandfather? Right? I think he doesn’t like to— I mean you two don’t, talk so much, right?
Anything. Just get him to ask me.
Uh-huh. Hm. Right.
He wants some sourdough tips!
Hey. It was just an idea. What did you get him anyway?
Money.
Dude, he’s gonna love it. He can let it rise while he does his yoga?
Dad – are we—?
What’s the deal?
Er – yeah. So. . On the family trust, that will decide the situation in the event of my unlikely demise. I’m going to add Marcia to myself and you four.
Whoa? Okay?
With my seat also to go to her on my death—
What, which would give her, double voting weight?
Uh-huh. So I’ve got the paperwork for—
What so, Marcia will have two votes when you—?
 he—
Well no, Rome, it’s not an if?

Well it doesn’t matter what we want in this case, Rome?
Kendall’s already signed up but if I can get you all to—
Two? Two votes. I don’t think I was aware of that when I—
Read the small print, asshole!
This looks— I mean, yeah. But, I might need to talk to— You know, for all the implications?
Of course.
Just to get the full picture?
Sure. Take a beat. But look, I love the bread – goo and the picture book, but this is the present I really want? So by four, good? And also, I just mentioned this to Kendall, but despite the chatter, and all things considered I’m going to give it a couple of years.
As in?
I’ll stay in situ. As Chairman, CEO and head of the firm.
Dad, you what?
Well I just said, son, or were you not listening as usual?
But – I’m, you’re not—  ??
No big deal. I’m just staying on. We can discuss the details.
You   tell me.
We can announce you’re in pole position. Pending events. A move up or some—
‘Pending events’?
Okay, lunch! C’mon.
Dad?
Oh fuck!!
Well I don’t know what you’re fucking laughing about!
I’m not even laughing – what?
What the fuck? This is – this is going to be a shitstorm. He’s going to blow the firm’s credibility. Did he look okay by you?
Oh come on! Ken. This is typical.
I’m out – okay, I’m not playing. Whatever you three say – goes. Goodbye!
Con!
On the trust, I refuse to play. I don’t want to engage. I’m water, I just flow.
This doesn’t stand, right? Oh fucking  , you’re fucking   me …  ? Are you messaging? What are you …
Hey! What the fuck? Off the cloth, moth! Private! We’re not fourteen, dude!
What are you—? Are you telling? This stays in here. This is a lockdown—
We all need advice, man—
Advice – what? You’re gonna give a double vote to a power-hungry maniac who will do   with it because she’s got our dad’s dick in some super-max pussy grip and she’s juicing him before he croaks—!
Oh, dude, come on—
Um, guys? Lunch is coming up—
Sure thing.
Sorry, guys, I know you don’t get to see each other much but we’re nearly—?
No fine, thanks, apologies—
Not at all. It’s do as you please here. It’s not like we’re in a maximum-security penitentiary.
Hey. So you’ve fucked me?
I changed my mind, Kendall—
When? When  ? Cos it feels like you fucked me.
I had doubts and then certain things caused me to rethink.
When? Like what? This is—
It’s me. It’s mainly me. But you – you’re still— Three years ago you were still in the nuthouse.

It’s all good. I’m just worried – you might be soft, as yet.
Are you kidding? I’m battle-hardened. Fucking year in Shanghai.
I hear the guy from the website trash-talked you and you let him just come?
Not a website. And I was being professional!
I hear it played weak. Conflict-averse.
I wasn’t about to get into a fucking big-dick competition.
I hear you bent for him.
What?
I hear you bent for him and he fucked you?
Well, no.
Thing is, you’ve probably read a lot of books about management technique and this and that but you know what?
What?
Sometimes it is a big-dick competition.
That’s it is it? I should have shouted at some guy? But I didn’t? So you’ve ripped up eighteen months of corporate strategy?
And you never lawyered the trust change.
Oh, I   my father. That’s a black mark?
It’s an – an accumulation. You left the room. The deal.
To come to my dad’s fucking birthday party? We don’t know how many more there’ll be! So come on. When will you be ready? To step down?
I don’t know – five?
Five  ?!
Ten?
Ten!! Dad? Seriously?
It’s my fucking company.
Yeah and you’re running it into the ground. You spend all your time on costs – where’s the vision? You’re off the beat. Where’s the growth? All our graphs go down. All of them.
That’s why you’re paying a billion dollars for a gay little website?
It is   a fucking  ! It’s a portfolio of online brands and digital video content and it’s part of a strategy to save us if you’ll just let me —
Do you want to hit me, is that it?
For fuck’s sake.
Are you going to cry?
You know I’ve been floated already? There’s fucking paps outside. I’m getting asked for quotes?
Fuck them.
Yeah, course, ‘fuck them’. Great media strategy, Dad, great business strategy. When the Street hears, when the board hears?   sold a very promising digital platform for buttons. You just fucking missed it, okay? Fine. Everyone misses things. But you gotta let me get our beak in. The world is—
Yeah yeah. Everything changes. The studio was gonna tank when I bought it, everyone was gonna stay home with videotapes, then guess what – no, they wanna go out. Everyone told me no one wanted to watch network, except you make it zing and they do. You make your own reality. But once you’ve done it, then, apparently, everyone’s of the opinion, it was all fucking obvious? Lunch!!
Um, that was delicious.
Thank you.
Not at all.
No, absolutely fantastic. The whole day. So thoughtful.
Suck-up. ‘Gee you’re so great, Double-Vote-Power Mom!’
Fuck you.
And Greg, how’s your mom?
Oh good. I mean she can play the – the – nut-crusher, but she’s  great.
Oh that’s good. That is good.
Okay. Thank you very much. Now, when we’re done. It’s time for the game.
We’re playing the game?
Well, it’s my birthday so yes we’re playing the game!
You okay, Greg?
Sure – I’m not …
Wanna jump in with Frank or Connor?
Um. I think— Is there room in there?
I’m sorry if it’s a crush?
S’fine.
Yeah, I was just talking. To your brother? Grandpa.
Uh-huh.
He said, ‘Happy birthday’.
Did he?
Well. No. I guess. Not. But he is aware it’s your birthday.
Uh-huh.
But it occurred to me. Talking to him, and Mom, that having him with his seat on the – on the holding company, still, from historically. That must be suboptimal, in some ways? But if I could – if he was willing to give his seat, eventually, to someone more – perspicacious. Who could learn the ropes, running say a theme park. Would that, maybe, be a win-win?
Running parks?
Just learning. Just a little guy. Initially. Could that be—? You scratch my back … I wouldn’t say I could scratch yours. It’s too considerable. But – you scratch my back, I you know, not suck your— But. Is there an angle there perhaps?
 … I don’t like Lefty.
Which?
Lefty.
Lefty? Yeah? He’s – he’s a trusted— You’ve had him before?
I don’t want him flying me.
Uh-huh?
He’s safe, I’m sure. But we had that bumpy touchdown on the Vineyard? He looks like a prick.
Not a problem – do you want me to – let him go?
He’s fine. Just—
You go Righty. Who shall I send in Lefty?
I don’t— Greg or Connor and—? It’s fine. You decide. did
Can we go? What’s going on, Colin?
Just jump into that bird, Shiv, thank you!
So what you thinking, son? . On the thing? She’s really smart. She’d make good picks. Family first.
Oh sure. I’m sure.
So?
So? Well, you know. I guess, I want to do anything for you. . But—
But, where’s your cut?
No. God no. It’s your firm, Dad. It’s not ‘what’s in it for me’. But you know, what   in it for me?
I would love to get you back in?
Sure. Sure. It was just tough last time.   tough, with Frank over me, in LA.
Frank is important to the firm.
Oh sure. I understand. It’s just, at the studio I had ideas, I’m quite an innovative thinker, but I found a certain amount of resistance?
Is this still the film thing?
No, what?  ? It’s not about one great idea. It was a culture. I think he was maybe threatened by my energy?
So what would be your dream outfit?
Oh, I don’t know. You know me, I think we should liquidate. Financialize. Who wants pipes and product. When you can float hot with pure cash?
Uh-huh.
But if not. I’d wanna run the show. But, till that opened up. Chief Operating Officer. But I guess, that’s Frank?
Uh-huh.  
How you feeling. We good?
Yep, sure. I’m not totally against Marcia as a concept. And you know Tom would love to oversee the parks? He’d be good?
He would? Okay … And for you. If things are getting shaken up, would you come inside?
Dad, I’m not just playing with the politics.
No sure. Politics. Politics. Shiv, not to be crude, sweetheart, but politics is what comes out the asshole. Wouldn’t you like to be up front, feeding the horse?
My guy, he’s got that Airforce One look.  So to come back, I’d want the top job.
And if that was difficult? Overseeing everything outside the US – parks and all?
What, me Tom’s boss?
Yeah? Stepping stones.
What’s the long-lost cousin sniffing around for?
Oh he screwed up. Needs help.
Are you gonna sprinkle some sugar in his bowl?
I like him.
You like him?
Kind of. He’s scratchy. Hungry. I think he might fit at the parks eventually? Could Tom handle competition?
Yeah so – just wanted to give this to you. And say ‘happy birthday’.
Thanks.
Yeah it’s just a Patek Philippe. So. It’s incredibly accurate. Every time you look at it, it tells you exactly how rich you are.
That’s everything I look at, Tom.
My lawyer says it needs to be simple majority.
Same. So what are you thinking?
Well – starting position is – I’m diluting my power and that’s, probably a no, right?
Absolutely. My thing would be, why would we do this? Shiv’s saying she’s for no, on Marcia?
Well – no, I said— That’s my   position.
Oh, I thought—
It depends.
Uh-huh, it   depend.
How does it depend?
What the final situation is?
Plus, do you want to tell Dad no?
That’s not a big deal.
Yeah?? You’ll stick the bottle brush up the Lion King’s butthole?
As a group, we could just— Sure. I’d cram that shit right up.
He’ll put a kebab skewer through your eyeball.
Look my thing is – maybe it’s a package. Here’s the deal: we say no – all of us on the trust, full block. We say: stability. Stick to the plan. I take over – and we just – you two, under me – co-presidents?
Under you?
Uh-huh. But three. The power of three?
Interesting.
Can we think about it?
Of course—
Yeah I thought about it, fuck you!
So I hear you’re the new kid?
Oh well I only just started to get into the business I’m not even—
I’ve got my eye on you. You need any help, advice— just, you know— . don’t fucking bother okay? Are you tripping?
Right? As in?
I’m only razzing you, cuz! You’re dreaming! Relax. Pals, yeah? Would you kiss me, if I asked you? If I told you to?
Kiss you? I don’t …
Your face! Haha! Fuck me, man. That was an expression. Pals!
Oh – okay. Apologies. Hold it. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay. Okay. I’m out of here. It’s the crunch. Frank, will you be linkman here? Dad, can I—
Of course. Everything okay?
If Kendall’s going we need one more to make it fair!  You wanna?
Sure?
C’mon. You’re up. Relax. Can you hit a ball? Cos I’ll give you a million dollars if you hit a home run, kid. I don’t know why you’re smiling. Seriously. A million.
Hey, I’ll do it for a million! I’m kidding – you’re good.
Grace, where’s my—
Rome?
Oh you don’t want him incentivized! One million dollars for a home run.
Okay. We okay?  – 
Ah, man. You choked! You choked it! Still you tried. Here’s quarter of a million!
Yeah – hey it’s just background for the story I heard you had cooking? Yeah I know Kendall Roy. And he’s saying Logan’s lost it. Kendall loves him but he’s slowing down. Making bad calls. Some major shareholders are worried. That’s what I’m hearing from people close to the family— those disloyal fucks.
Hey. Lawrence. Sorry the other offer evaporated. But we fattened the goose nice now, right?
I hear it’s a decent package.
The number is one-forty. Cash with a stock alternative. You’re on our board. Take the stock and you’ll own a nice piece of us. Rockstar salary.
Well that is an appealing package.
It is, yeah. It’s appealing.
You better play nice though. Because I’m the whole company.
No. You’re OFM. One Fungible Motherfucker. You think you’re so fucking hip but all I want is the brand. The whole firm is just so much fairy dust. It just happens I want some today.
Well we’ll see if I choose to—
Yeah I think you’re going to stick around. I’m going to stuff your mouth with so much gold. Non-disclosure agreement. Non-compete. I’m going to lock you in a golden cage, fuck you with a silver dildo and pay you so much you sing whatever song I want.
Easy. You still need me to recommend this or—
No, this is a deal so fucking good you have to take it, or we’ll see you in court.
You wanted five?
Yeah. Frank. I’ve been thinking if now isn’t a time for a new role for you?
Okay? As in. What sort of—?
Light duties.
‘Light duties’? Are you kidding? Logan. Me?
No one has as much respect as me for you, Frank—
Oh no. No, c’mon, fuck this—
It’s a step up. The press release should be on your phone. Just proof it. You might want to add some color, it’s quite dry.
That’s it? To  Here? You are what you do, Logan. You know that? In the end you’re just what you do.
Yeah well, you’ll get your nut. Hey, kids?
So. What you say, kids?
What’s the Frank situation?
Frank’s out of the picture.
Yeah? Fuck.
Frank’s dead. Tom should be stepping up. Shiv’s thinking about a new role. So, are we good?
Um? Shiv?
Rome?
Um? Con?
I’m with these two. What they say goes.
Our position is that this doesn’t quite work for us. At present.
You what?
It’s not sufficiently attractive. As a proposition.
Are you fucking joking?
We get that. We do. We’d like to help. I’d love to help.
Then help.
But – why would I? When— I mean— Giving   power. Why would I do that? —
Dad? It’s just a first position?
Dad? Dad.
Dad!
Dad?
Take us— Get us to a hospital.
Dad? Are you—?
What’s Dad—? Are you—?
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Thank you. Kendall? You heard?
What?
Deal. It’s very exciting. I can’t wait to join your board.
I think you’ve made a great decision and I hope there’s no hard feelings over all the cock-jousting.
Nuh-huh. You win.
 yes!
Your dad just had a brain hemorrhage.
What?
I’m sorry. I’m sorry for you.
Are you? Is this—?
But you just invited me into your chicken coop. And I’m going to eat you all. One by fucking one.
Hello?
We’ve got an eighty-year-old male, found with LOC. Vitals are BP one-ninety over one-oh-two, pulse at ninety-four. Respiration at twelve. Patient only responsive to pain is on high-con O2 at fifteen- LPM. He’s unstable. I’ve spoken to the daughter, she can’t tell me what meds he’s on.
Why aren’t we moving? Why the fuck aren’t we moving?
We’re in traffic. We’ll get there.
Still unresponsive. Take eight vials and get them to the lab.
How long, how long does the satnav say? Which app is that? Cross-check, cross-check Waze and Google Maps and Apple Maps. I don’t care about the traffic! Make it. Let’s make it. Let’s weave, man. This is my father. Middle lane! My father’s dying, let’s get me there, let’s do it. Roman? What? Is he okay? Stop crying, buddy. Please. I can’t understand anything you’re saying, man. Seriously. You’re going to make me cry. I’m there, I’m nearly there. I’ll be there now, man, okay? Hang tight. I love you. Tell Dad I love him. Okay? Oh fuck. Oh fuck. We need – we need. I don’t know what we need.
Ken, we’ll be there. We’ll get there. You can’t park there.
Talk to him. My dad might be dying!
Hey. Are you okay? Do we know anything? Are you okay?
Yeah. No. Yeah.
What can I do to make this better? Tea? Call your mom?
No.
Shiv, I’m human Siri, task me.
Um, tell Sarah to get Dad’s doctor. And research the best neurologists.
I will action that.
Maybe I should? I should go through my diary with her, clear it out, and you won’t know what’s important …
Hey. I’m doing it. I’ve done it. It’s already happened. Forget it.
Sorry, you need to be in the waiting area.
What were you and Marcia saying?
What?
You were just – you were looking at me and talking?
She said, ‘You’re my favorite, don’t tell Shiv.’ What do you think? She asked what happened. So I told her.
It will be okay, I promise. I’m here.
Thanks, big man. Huge relief.
Hey come on? Just saying, lean on me.
Hey. Where are we at? How is he?
I’m sorry, we need this area clear.
I just arrived? I don’t know where to stand, okay? Show me where to stand and I’ll stand there.
Wise elders, Ken. These people do an incredible job.
Fuck. What’s the situation? Do we need to call anyone? What is this – part of the hospital, is this the best – section?
Excuse me, are we in the best part of the hospital? Sorry – but we need to—
The ICU is the ICU. This is the best place for him.
I told the staff to take Rava and Grace and the kids away, and bring them in later, yes?
Should the kids see this?
It’s good. It’s the cycle of life.
Well he’s not dying.
Nobody said he was dying.
He did.
I’m sorry, could you give the team some space?
Here’s an idea. How about you worry about the medicine, not the fucking feng shui?
Can you give us a picture please, and we want to just check this is the highest care level available? Look. Do they know who we are? Do they know who he is?
Should we call Mom?
No. What? There’s a million people to call. And she’ll make it about her.
I think you should call. I mean, it’s not like she’ll come. Will she?
Folks. You need to wait through there—
Hey, I’m sorry, we’re getting mixed messages. We have no clue what’s going on.
We’ll be with you as soon as we have an assessment.",0.45489340854378846,0.5600228677575405,0.3480006054760172,0.33265820857710565,0.39292576416180686,0.3584176751283499,0.4060450180648611,0.2831092639038196,0.421683403226332,0.3454222362775069,0.15487555565240865,0.11064598690897513,0.21327715183679874,0.39921178166718724,0.3254485560511687,0.21512317687559587,0.24595569652961924,0.1739733350284111,0.07822054315911373
2,"We need to know what’s happening. There are hundreds of thousands of American jobs dependent on his wellbeing.
‘Hundred of thousands of …’
Hey, I’ll say anything to get him the good medicine.
So, look, what happened, exactly?
I don’t know. It was freaky.
We were just talking.
Yep, one second Shiv was hardballing Dad, the next he mumbled something and – you know.
I wasn’t hardballing him, we were talking. A brain hemorrhage doesn’t come from some chit-chat?
It’s definitely a brain hemorrhage? Is that what they said?
Someone said brain hemorrhage? Right?
Did they? Or stroke?
Umm, the first – the ambulance guy?
A stroke is a hemorrhage.
Did someone say hemorrhage or is it just you who said it?
It could be an aneurysm?
Why aren’t we chasing this?
Is there any—? Did Dad ever talk to you guys about cryogenics?
Are you insane?
I’ll chase.
We need to call Dad’s doctor. And his neurologist. We need to be on this, now!
We already called Doctor Judith. We dropped that we know half the board. Kendall, I’m on it. We are checking out names. We all are trying to do the best. Back the fuck off.
According to this it sounds like a stroke. Could be an acute subdural hematoma.
Great, get in there and operate, Doctor Google.
He once talked to me about cryogenics. What, wouldn’t that be typical, all the other billionaires are strolling around with new bodies but not Dad because we were too embarrassed to actually discuss it?
Let’s just worry about keeping him alive till tomorrow, before we worry about the next thousand years, yeah?
I know. And on his birthday too. It’s so shitty.
What’s happening now? Are you staying at the hospital?
I guess. I think I’ve got a job, but I don’t know. Logan said I did. But Marcia was the only one there. And then he tragically, you know. Should I ask her?
What sort of job? A good job? A blowjob?
I don’t know. I can’t believe he offered me a job and then he had a brain hemorrhage, it’s so unfair … Unfair for him, I mean. And everyone. I have like twenty bucks. The world is so fucked up.
I am not sending you any more money, Greg. Step up. Harvest an organ. And make sure. About the job. Because that side of the family, they’ll spit in your face and charge you for moisturizer.
I know. I know it. They are.
Just don’t do or say anything stupid. I need to call your grandpa and let him know—
Do you have cash?
Er. No. Not— Just—
Thanks.
ATN obituary. They want us to okay it in case they have to run it?
Is it nice?
Made by his own news outfit? It doesn’t say he was a prick. You
Well I’d love to see you. Yes, it’s appropriate. It could hardly be more appropriate.
There’s nothing in here about Mom, or Connor’s mom. They need to be included.
PJ says Aziz Khan at the Mayo Clinic is the best there is.
I know a great hypnotherapist.
Uh-huh, interesting. You think this is a good time to get him to stop biting his nails?
I meant for  . For recovery. Roman.
Sarah says Ann Wieman at NYU.
That’s not the name I have.
Well it’s the name I have. Tell her to call them. —

Hi, I’m Doctor Lewis, the senior neurologist here— So. We’ve done everything we can to stabilize Mr Roy—
And is he okay?
He’s fine. It’s a fucking power-nap. Medical siesta.
I’m sorry, I can’t tell you more until we know the results of the CT scan, but we’ll have those soon.
Doctor, look, ranked, what are the most likely outcomes?
Right now I’m afraid all outcomes are possible. We’ll know more soon. I’m sorry. It would be misleading to say more right now.
It’s most probably a hemorrhagic stroke. I did zoology. Animals also have strokes. Even reptiles. So.
It’s fine. He’ll never retire and he’ll never die.
Already? People are sending shit already?
It’s from Lawrence.
Call him and tell him that is not fucking appreciated.
Can I get five? We need to talk to you.
Obviously the board, the nominating committee, has a plan in the event of Logan’s incapacitation …
Do I need to hear this right now?
You do. The guy’s an ox, we know that, but—
The stock is not in great shape as it is and—
I am not thinking about the stock right now, okay?
I know. I know.
Nor are we. Nor is anyone.
Nevertheless. If we carry on, on – the current trajectory in terms of his – consciousness – we need to announce a plan by around six-thirty before the markets open to avoid a lot of – funky chowder.
‘Funky chowder’?
If you want to— We’ve set up through here?
What have you set up?
You’re gonna want somewhere to – be. We spoke with a hospital trustee, just to make sure everybody knows who’s who around here.
This isn’t a war room as yet.
But if we need one, it’s available.
There’s so much going on. This must be very confusing.
Can’t we just talk here?
You know Connor’s invited Willa down?
Ugh. Here? Why would he do that?
I don’t know. He saw an empty bed and it made him horny? I have no idea. — But listen, so I was thinking – this must be tough on Marcia.
Yeah? You’re thinking that? What? Will she put all her inheritance into gold, or oil?
No, look I know the trust only comes into play if certain things happen—
He’s dead. Or brain dead.
But I was thinking, wouldn’t it be nice for Dad to wake up and for us all to have signed, like he wanted? A nice gesture?
And if he dies? We’ve signed over to Marcia, basically, the power to choose the new Dad.
So, for the record, you’re declining to sign the change of trust?
‘For the record’? What is this, McCarthyism? I’m not declining. I’m just not – clining.
Okay. It just seems a bit shitty. Under the circumstances …  ?
What circumstances?
Well, you did make her husband’s brain explode …
Fuck off—
Jesus. Hi.
We’ve implied we might be making a totally unrelated donation to the hospital?
There’s a bathroom through there. I have Dewi and Asha from the nominating committee on the line. Kendall’s here and you’re on speaker, guys.
Hi, Kendall, it’s Dewi. So sorry about the news.
Likewise. How’s he doing?
Er – we don’t know.
As you know, our standing plan, in the event of Logan’s … ‘absence’ is we separate his CEO and Chairman roles.
You become acting CEO, Frank stays on as COO and steps up from Vice Chairman to acting Chair—
Look, my dad is my focus right now.
Of course. It’s just – there’s a problem in terms of – you know, in terms of the optics if what happened between you two today gets out?
I don’t know what you’re talking about.
Sure. Well—
And then there’s the problem with Frank?
As in?
Logan fired him. And promoted Roman.
Roman? Jesus.
So, in this, uhh, situation, with your father having you know, cast some doubt on you in a – in a way, and Frank, we just wonder if …
It’s a difficult position.
He didn’t tell you about Roman?
I’m sorry, I can’t get into this right now.
Of course. You’re in no fit state.
But here’s my take. My dad got sick today. Right? I don’t know, nobody knows when he started acting out of character, but he didn’t seem great from the morning on, and, there’s no paper on any of the moves made today, right, Gerri?
Nothing meaningful.
It was words and words are – what? Nothing. Complicated airflow. So, if I was saying what     today? It would be nothing.
Well that would certainly make things simpler from our point of view? And simple’s good. Can you get the family behind it?
Yes.
And Frank?
Sure.
Frank? Pal. Listen, you’ve heard, right? Can I possibly get five?
We’re here for you, Marcia.
It’ll be okay.
You know, the irony is for all we spend the US actually has the worst health outcomes of any developed nation.
Easy. Yeah?
Hey, don’t shoot the messenger. Because he would   stand a great chance of recovery.
I’m here for you too. This is so unfair, he’s a good man – he let me come to his birthday lunch, he offered me a job … He doesn’t deserve this. If there’s anything I can do let me know.
Actually there is something.
Great.
Can you go to the apartment and get his bed things and slippers? With the dark checks. For if, for when he wakes up? You don’t mind, do you?
No. I’d be delighted. Not delighted … Happy. Willing.
Marcia, we can get the housekeeper, or the driver or Colin to—
I don’t need that fly buzzing in my face.
Don’t fuck it up!
Listen, Greg, I need a favor. Dad wanted us to sign some paperwork today – it’s in some envelopes back at home, I need you to bring it in. Don’t look so worried, man! You can pretend like you’ve got a job working for FedEx?
Better not fuck this one up. I don’t want Logan Roy’s newspapers going through my trash cans.
Well then you shouldn’t do so much meth.
We still have to try to save his life, right? Even though he’s a horrible person?
I believe so. I think technically, that’s the case. South Park
What are people saying?
Oh just rumors, ‘taken to the hospital’. Some of Twitter says he’s dead. A good deal of – of – rejoicing at our father’s potential demise. Can you screengrab these fuckers who are saying shit?
Shiv, it’s Sarah. Sorry, something’s come up. Can I call?
Scan. And the news is out.
Okay? Right. Well— So, um, listen, I don’t want to even think about this but I just spoke to the nominating committee.
The thing is, that the plan is to announce that I take over from Dad. That’s the plan.
Well, no.
Excuse me?
Let’s not— We’re waiting for the results of the scan, so it’s a pointless conversation.
Okay, well, let’s talk about it—
I can’t talk about it, I’m upset.
Hey, I’m upset too!
Not too upset to go and fucking plot with the suits?
Oh fuck you. I could – I could hardly hear them for the blood rushing in my ears and—

Yes there’s a plan – that’s what I’m fucking telling you!
Well I’m not sure—
Shiv, that’s what we have to talk about, me and Frank will take over.
Well Frank was fired, so?
Okay, well let’s discuss – and just see where we are and—
We’re not doing this. If Dad dies I do not want to be talking about this shit when he dies.
He won’t die.
Yes? Hi, this is Isobel Silva at  , I’m sorry to be in contact at this difficult time, but we’ve just emailed you the lede of a story – we’re looking into the events of the last twenty-four hours and I wondered if you’d like to comment?
What events? What story? How Logan Roy was going to make you Head of Waystar and then withdrew the offer and how his brain hemorrhage has created a power vacuum at the heart of the company. Did you have a comment on that?
Okay, I’ve got no comment. But off the record, yeah? You’re a vulture. You’re a fucking piece of shit, and I hope you’ve got a good contract cos if you ever need a job anywhere else in news, anywhere, I’ll see what I can do to make sure you’re fucked, forever. Goodnight.
Hi? I’m really sorry but I don’t have any money to pay for the cab?
I’m sorry, sir, do I know you?
I was here earlier. I got assaulted a little? Can you pay for the cab, please? She said she’d call, but maybe she didn’t because there’s an emergency and anyway I don’t have any money, so could you pay for my cab, because it’s an emergency? And I gave my last twenty to the family, for Coke? Bottles of Coke.
Sir, I’m sorry, I don’t know who you are.
So, basically he won’t lend me the money, so he owes you your money. You better give me the money, dude. Look you two need to figure this out, because basically, one of you guys hasn’t got fourteen dollars, okay? Look, can you just call Mrs Roy?
Can you?
I – I don’t know her number?
Oh, hi, Mrs Roy.
I’m so sorry. So – weird.
I actually like hospitals. Lots of people don’t, but they’re safe.
Is that bubble okay?
I don’t— I assume so?
The weird thing for me, is I was – I’d been intending to – talk to Logan and then, make a proposal. I’ve actually been meaning to ask for his blessing for a while, but now it’s very difficult.
Right.
I’ve been carrying the ring around for months!
You need to find the right time for these conversations.
Right. The weird thing I’m thinking now is, do you think Logan would still like to be asked? I know he can’t reply. But would he appreciate the gesture? If he was told about it later? Or even in the case of the worst – would that be nice to have asked, his body?
Umm—
I guess my question is, I’d really like to ask her, but do you think Logan would be angry if I asked Shiv without asking him, even though it’s hard to ask him because he’s – you know?
You should do whatever you think is right, Tom.
You know what, I’m just going to— Excuse me! Is this bubble, is it okay for a little bubble to go into him—?
All fine, it’s not our first rodeo.
Thank you. Not entirely appropriate language. This is a human being. Not a horse.
Hey. Do you want to talk? Because I’ve got something—
Apparently I need to get a briefing. Sarah? What’s going on?
I’m actually, I wanted, in case you needed me to be available—
Sure, come on in.
Fine – I’ll be with you shortly. Instantly, really. I wanted to be near.
Sorry, Tom, could you give us a minute? So?
So – you don’t need to get into this, I’ve got it, but so you know the territory— Daniel called me.
Joyce’s husband?
He said he thinks something bad could have happened? That could hurt Joyce’s campaign.
Oh what the fuck now?
He says there’s been a hack on a dating site. Filthy Rich? For married people who want to fuck around?
Delightful. Was he on it?
He says – it’s complicated.
Oh great.  . Of course it is.

I’ll do it.
Yeah because—
It’s fine. Get me this profile. Then talk to Daniel, ask him if someone was being horrible, if someone was being shitty, what the worst thing they could find was? Okay?
They’re gonna give us the results?
Okay. Fuck. You okay, man?
He’ll be fine. He’s probably in there eating a fucking chicken bucket and checking the market.
He’s had a hemorrhagic stroke. A bleed in the deep right hemisphere put pressure on his thalamus and brainstem and that’s what caused loss of consciousness.
So, what? Do you operate?
We don’t do that for deep bleeds, especially in older patients.
He’s not an ‘older patient’.
Dude, he just turned eighty.
But physically, he’s basically still in his seventies. And he’s in great shape. Thirty years.
The evidence is that operating in these situations isn’t worthwhile.
Well you can’t do nothing.
We’re carrying out regular observations. Hopefully, we’ll see an improvement soon.
That’s not good enough, right, Doctor Judith?
It’s an excellent department.
Well thanks for your input but you’ll understand if we check our options – my assistant’s spoken to Ann Wieman at NYU and we might move Dad there.
No. He stays here. He gets better here.
Well, we can discuss. We’ll discuss and get back to you.
No. No discussion. I’m his next of kin, I’m his proxy – I’m in charge. Thank you.
Good. We’ll move Logan to a suite in Greenberg. I’ll show you the way.
I’m sorry, Ken. How is the old bastard?
Not great. He’ll be fine.
You okay, Kenny?
Maybe. Yeah. Look, I don’t know what the fuck I’m doing. I need to get back in there – this is nuts. I’ll call you. Look, we don’t know what’s going on. He could be fine, he could not. Either way he’s not going to be back tomorrow. So long story short: will you carry on as COO and step up on the board and—?
Become Acting Chairman?
Yes.
No.
What?
He fired me, Ken.
I don’t know if he even knew what he was saying? If his brain was working.
His brain was working fine.
Look, whatever else, there’s no proof, legally, that yesterday even happened …
That’s not the problem.
What’s the problem?
I just don’t want to be Chairman. I am just an attendant lord, here to swell a scene or two.
Look – this is a horrible day. But it could also be a, a – positive day. Me and you? Yeah? Me CEO, you Chairman. We could do great things together— What do you need, Frank?
A jazillion dollars in unmarked bitcoin. I don’t have a price, Ken.
Frank, I don’t understand?
Just— We’ll talk. There’s a lot of mess to be cleaned up, Kendall, but you can do it, son. You can.
There’s nothing I can say to change your mind?
I’m sorry about your father. And good luck, Kenny.
So I asked Greg to bring the change of trust—
What?
—and when he brings them, we should sign them.
I’m not doing anything without my lawyer.
Well I’m going to sign and I’m getting Connor to sign so that’s going to make you look pretty fucking heartless when you don’t? Oooh, scary look. You hit me again I will ask them to sedate you.
Greg, did you find the contracts Roman asked for?
Yes, I’m on it, I have them!
I think you have the wrong ones.
Oh. Okay?
That’s possible. So—
Um. Right. What shall I do—?
Look, there’s a lot of confusion. Cuz, if you have any doubt, maybe you can’t find them and that might be simplest?
Uh-huh? But if I do?
Don’t bring them.
Did he change his mind?
No, I’m just telling you – don’t bring them in.
Okay. So what’s the chain of command here? It’s— Are you the more senior sibling?
Greg. This is a favor I’d like you to do for me, and I’d like you to be discreet. It’s simple. You stay for a while, you can’t find them, you come back. Okay? Thank you.
Nothing yet.
What?
Um, we’re good. We’ve been digging and I’ve got the situation covered.
It’s okay?
Shall we just do it tomorrow?
It’s fine, just tell me.
Okay there’s a picture related to his profile. Embedded in some chat. You won’t want to see it—
If I won’t want to see it, I need to see it.  –  Is that— What …? Is that … an asshole?
It’s his asshole.
No. I can’t— No. I’m not contactable tonight, okay? No.
Um, look, so I know you don’t want to talk about this, but I’m just informing you Roman as a board member, and Shiv as a shareholder, I’ll be taking temporary charge as CEO and Chairman. Frank is not interested in the position at present and therefore—
I’m sorry but even if we were talking about it, which we’re not, it wouldn’t necessarily be you, bro.
I’m sorry then who the fuck would it be?
I don’t know. Anyone. It could be me.
Are you insane?
Dad just made me COO?
I don’t think so, dude. Dad wasn’t thinking straight.
Well, I think he was.
You, the ‘Chief Operating Officer’? If that wasn’t a sign he was loco in the coco I don’t know what is.
I don’t see it that way.
It was a position, Rome, he was playing you, do you even know what it fucking involves? He conked out midgame.
Are you saying I’m a dipshit?
No. Rome! I love you, man, but you’re not a serious person.
Fuck you! He’s alive, you’re not the fucking boss—
Look, hey, let’s not throw our shit around. We’re in the middle. This is why we just hold tight, no sudden moves.
Well we need to move. The markets are going to want to know who’s behind the wheel. We need to control the narrative.
‘Control the narrative’. You probably yell that when you cum.
Fuck you. Everyone knows he’s in the hospital, we have to say something.
But no one knows how serious it is, so we don’t have to say anything.
We’re required to announce. There are rules, there are laws.
Oh no, the law? We couldn’t possibly break the law.
Karolina, has a CEO ever been out of action and people haven’t been told?
Not that I can think of. There was Apple but—?
But can we drag our feet on this, till we figure out the moves?
Well, once we know, there’s a duty to shareholders to let people—
But I don’t know what we know! It’s unclear. It could be flu, it could be an allergic reaction?
Oh come on! Look at the fucking orchids! It’s like we’re being held hostage at the Honolulu Airport.
But if we wanted to say – something, other than what is …
It’s called a lie, Shiv. When you say the thing that’s not. That’s a lie.
We need to make a holding statement. But of course I’m open to your suggestions on how we finesse it.
Thank you. We’ll make a decision shortly.
Lawrence. How you doing?
Kendall—
Yeah so listen I’m just calling to issue a reminder. Your pecker’s in my pocket, okay, Dickless Dickleby? I just got bothered by some piece of guttershit about my dad and what went down yesterday. I’m just making sure you weren’t planning a move in that direction?
Well, Vaulter and all our satellite sites have editorial independence, as set out in our agreement—
You know what that piece of paper is to me? Nothing. I’d jerk off on that paper and send it to you as a greeting card. You do what I say. Let others say what they want but we stay dark. You get me? So Simon Says: ‘Fingers on lips, motherfucker.’
It’s been a tough day for Ken.
It has. I feel sorry for him.
And I don’t want to talk about this now but the fact is, if he becomes Acting CEO, he’ll end up CEO.
Yeah, right, that’s the flow.
And maybe we’re happy? It’s just a question of who would Dad want to be in charge—?
That’s right.
I tell you what he really   need, is Dad waking up and going apeshit at him for trying to seize the company while he was unconscious?
No, he does not need that.
I guess, and I don’t want to get into this, but I think we need to just cut off the whole Kendall CEO thing. Because otherwise it could get painful?
Well, I’m not looking for it but I guess I’m already COO so another small step and—?
It won’t be you.
Because?
Come on?
I don’t know what that means?
Yes you do.
It doesn’t matter who does it, it’s temporary, anyone will do.
Sure. Anyone. Tom? Karl?
Prick. Eva?
Cunt. Frank?
Basically dead.
I mean it could be anyone. It’s only temporary?
So who? Someone Dad trusts. Dad doesn’t trust anyone. Apart from Frank. And he fired Frank for shits and giggles. Gerri?
I don’t love Gerri, I don’t even like Gerri, but I don’t hate Gerri.
I’ll talk to her.
Logan Roy, CEO and Chairman of Waystar Corporation, has been admitted to New York Presbyterian Hospital after suffering an unspecified medical emergency. He is undergoing treatment and is currently listed as being in a serious condition. The Waystar board has scheduled an emergency board meeting and will make a statement in due course.
So what do you think I do?
What did she say?
Roman said bring in the papers, Shiv said don’t bring in the papers?
I guess you need to decide which one of them is more important?
I guess – Roman’s in the firm but Shiv seems like more … I don’t know, bossy?
Well, I don’t know.
And I don’t know which slippers. Is checked the same as plaid? Cos then you have gingham. And tartan. It’s a fucking criss-cross minefield.
Fuck the slippers, Greg. You have to strategize.
I’m trying to strategize, Mom, with you but you won’t strategize!
Can you just – stay?
Just stall? Stalling doesn’t seem proactive. Is stalling proactive?
I don’t know.
I’m trying to brainstorm with you, Mom. But you’re not bringing anything to the table!
I bought a cookie to split. I assumed we wouldn’t be able to face a donut right now.
Is it definitely his?
I mean, an asshole’s like a fingerprint, isn’t it, so we will be able to – tell, eventually.
Is an asshole like a fingerprint?
Um, you mean because of the – the puckers?
The google on this is – it’s, it’s not one of those searches with a really
Can we find out if an asshole has—?
Hi. Excuse me, guys, quick question, and sorry to bother you but does an asshole have a fingerprint?
I’m sorry?
Is every asshole unique?
Um, I don’t know. Do you know?
Thanks, guys! Someone fell asleep in asshole class … Can we chase that?
They’re pretty anonymous, right? I mean, could you pick out yours?
Was the account in Daniel’s name?
His credit card details are in there, anonymized so, it might not come out. But it might.
Could we say the profile was set up by a friend? As a joke?
Who’s the friend, what’s their name, why, when, how, where’s the card, it’d last like, three to five hours?
We could say he meant to take a good, old-fashioned dick pic and got the angle wrong?
‘He’s such a dick he couldn’t even snap his own dick’? I don’t know if that helps …
Joyce wants to see you. Do you have the time? Do you want me to say no?
I don’t know. I don’t fucking know.
Listen, can I get a moment alone with you do you think …  ?
Have you seen this?
I’m so sorry about your father.
Thank you. Could you give us a minute?
Oh come on, I am not the same as her.
Lawrence is running a story about how the company’s in turmoil.
Don’t we own him? ‘Shit Show at the Fuck Factory’?
Uncertainty, discord. That is not a good story. ‘Family Gets Behind Other Member of Family’, that’s a good story.
Fuck them. When Jobs was croaking, Apple didn’t say anything.
We’re in a hospital, Shiv. Everyone knows. We can’t just prop him up and wave his hand and say he’s fine like they did in the Politburo or fucking  .
I like the sound of that.
Look you can’t put a value on a human life. Except in our case you rather precisely can because when trading opens tomorrow we’re going to drop like a stone. The only question is, what’s the bottom? I think I’m the best option.
I just want to say – if you need me to go get coffee or sandwiches or step up from regional parks to run North America, I will, I can. That’s just an offer on the table.
Fuck off, Tom.
Fuck off, Kendall. Don’t talk to Tom like that.
It’s okay. It’s fine.
I was about to be announced, how can I not be the logical choice?
You were   announced, but then you weren’t, Ken. Look, I hate to say this but the only thing we know for certain, for absolute certain, is Dad didn’t want you to be boss. So if there was a list of the seven billion people on earth, you’re one of the very few people we’d know for sure Dad did not want running this company.
Dad fired you, man.
He did not fire me. He said it was just going to take a little longer.
He said that to be nice. What he meant was: You’re not up to it, and it’s going to be someone else.
The board are offering this to me. I don’t need your backing.
Well you do kind of need it, really?
I think you do. Without it, after what Dad did to you, we could take any appointment to court.
Jesus, Shiv, we’re going to court now?
Hey, I didn’t want to talk about this, remember?!
Look, what have you got against me?
Nothing.
Nothing?
What, do you want me to actually say?
Yes.
You lack killer instinct, you’re wet, you’re green, you’re intellectually insecure—
Oh my god! Bullshit.
You’re not emotionally strong enough, you have addiction issues—
No, no. I’ve heard enough.
I don’t think all that. I’m just trying to be Dad’s voice—
Bravo. It was an excellent impression. I just want to say – I’m not getting involved.
Good!
But Shiv’s right. I’m not saying I’d be a better CEO … That’s unsaid.
Hey – pal – why don’t you go make out with Willa?
Okay, you decide, I don’t even want to know. I just observe. I’m a UN White Helmet.
Who else are you going to get?
I think Shiv would do a great job.
Thanks, baby. No way.
She doesn’t work in the company and has no experience of the company and the markets would freak. But apart from that, I agree with you.
But we have options.
Sure, you could all ask for morphine. So you can carry on in your painless dreamworld where the orchids dance and the company’s run by a – hipster – fucking unicorn!
Look, I don’t want to do it. Which is ironic because that probably means I’m actually the person best suited to do it.
Response times can vary.
Hello, this is Greg.
Greg, how are you doing?
I’m not dawdling.
Listen, you’re at the apartment, right?
Um, just—
I know you’re getting PJs and all that shit. Just, pick up a sweater maybe. Also. My dad’s, okay?
Okay, which …?
Doesn’t matter. Not something washed. Something he’s worn, maybe, if you find one.
V-neck or crew. I guess it doesn’t matter, right?
Just smell it. Okay. Jesus. I just want something that smells of him, okay. I just want that. Is that enough for you?
Okay, dude. That’s nice. Sorry. I’ll … sniff some stuff.
Just whatever. And don’t tell anyone, or I’ll cut your dick off. And don’t forget those papers we talked about. And also – thanks. And fuck off.
So, Gerri. How you doing?
Oh fine. This is where they brought Baird, so it’s a little—
Baird?
My husband. Shiv’s godfather …?
Ohh. Does he – with the tortoise?
Yeah.
Yeah. Of course! How is he? Yeah, no I do, I remember. Anyhoo thanks, for captaining us through this shitstorm. You do a good job, Gerri. You are a real good job-doer, my friend. Look, I’m not great at the whole corporate flirt, I’d rather just lube up and fuck, you know?
I see.
Yeah – so, look, for me and Shiv the Kendall thing doesn’t work, so we’re thinking. General Counsel, you know where the bodies are buried, you probably buried them ‘ha-ha’, so, you’d have the family’s support to step in and take the reins. Okay?
Well that’s a generous offer but I’m going to have to decline.
Right. Can I ask why?
Why don’t I want the job that makes your brain explode?
Okay. But— Gerri, excuse me but I’ve always thought of you, and I mean this in the best possible way, as a stone-cold killer bitch?
And you said you couldn’t flirt … Shush now.
What are we talking about?
Tortoises and lube.
Great. Love all that stuff. Very happy to join in those conversations.
It’s nearly four a.m.?
I couldn’t sleep. Put the kids to bed and I felt like I was missing all the fun. So?
How are they doing?
The kids. They’re okay.
Would you mind bringing them in tomorrow? Just so they can say their … their, hellos.
How are you feeling?
Good. Yeah. I don’t know. Calm then – then, yeah. How am I feeling? Fuck. Ask me another.
Jesus, what a day for you.
Yeah. The nominating committee want me to be the big boss.
‘Yay.’
‘Yay.’ Acting. But Shiv and Roman won’t back me. Because of what Dad said at lunch.
Jesus, your family is so – fucked. I mean I’m sorry but— Is that— Kendall? I assume you’re aware that you’re prodding me?
What can I say. Adrenalin. I don’t know. It’s just my body. I’m glad you’re here.
Yeah, I can tell.
So, man, look, I’ve been thinking and this is my vision: We go for it. Me and you. CEO and COO. Me and my Homey Romey?
I thought I was a fuckhead?
A dipshit, and you said that?
You said I wasn’t serious.
It’s been a long night. But seriously, me and you, bro. I can teach you — and you can, you know, teach me.
And Shiv?
You know what Shiv’s like. She’s a daddy’s girl. She wants to play it safe. We’re the ones with the nuts to revolutionize.
Okay – I’m not uninterested.
Alright, then. Let’s fucking do it.
Only thing … Gerri turned down the top job. Does that mean something?
Are you fucking with me?
No.
This your move. Scare me off? Who asked Gerri?
It was mooted.
It was ‘mooted’? By who? Fucking Moot-zart? The Count of Mooty Cristo? Did you moot?
I’m just telling you what I know. So we trust each other.
I can’t believe my dad’s dying and I’m having to deal with this asshole’s asshole.
You know, there are men in the world who would never do this. And I’m one of them. To be clear. If that wasn’t—
Connor Roy. Big fan. . I mean I find your policy prescriptions laughable. But personally. Huge fan.
I’m so sorry about your father.
Sarah’s found us somewhere horrible.
Joyce, I’m so sorry he cheated on you. You deserve better.
He didn’t cheat on me.
Oh? Okay. But – it was his credit card? And his laptop?
Someone stole them.
Right? And did he report it?
He has multiple credit cards and multiple laptops. He’s a very successful businessman with a number of enemies, any one of whom could be targeting him or me for any number of reasons.
Joyce? What? If this comes out we’re just saying it wasn’t him?
Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. What should I do? This is just the  fucking day.
It’s okay. We – we— Look, let’s cool this off. Have you talked to him?
No. Yes. Kind of. If he fucks this for me, I will kill him. He’s in Portland. We Skyped. I thought there was someone else in the room but it was my echo. It all went wrong. He’s such a fucking— I don’t know. Do you trust him?
That’s not my area, Joyce.
You think I should leave him?
We’re weeks out from a Senate Primary.
So I’m stuck with him? Would it be crazy, to – focus-group the – the scenarios?
Yes. Yes, Joyce, that would be fucking crazy. Look, we can manage this. And you know, you need to do what feels right. No one can judge you. Except the voters, of course.
Oh come on, man. Not cool.
C’mon. Family get-together.
So, listen, I’ve asked Roman to be Acting COO—
Actual COO.
To my Acting CEO.
And you said?
I said, why not?
Snake.
Sis, please. I’m trying to bring us together here. I’m mediating.
Well I’m saying no.
Me too.
I thought you were a fucking White Helmet?
Sometimes the peacekeeper has to go to shoot a maniac on the perimeter.
Why would you say no to this and yes to Gerri?
Gerri’s been with the company for twenty years. Dad trusts her.

Yeah well, she doesn’t want it.
And so in my opinion we should find someone else, temporary.
Like who?
Someone neutral, anyone. Eva. What’s he called, American Psycho? Or Karl?
Karl? Yeah? You trust him? And what if it isn’t temporary? What if he uses his position to make it permanent?
He wouldn’t do that?
Wouldn’t he? How do you know?
He’s nice, he brought coffee.
Oh he bought coffee? Then we should definitely let him take control of the company?
Dude, Karl’s not going to—
It’s a gamble. It’s either me and Roman and us as a family. Or it’s Eva and Karl or some fuck-droid from the deep state of the company. They could take the company out of our hands, and we’d never get near it again. If Dad wakes up – and he’s frail and he’s looking at the endgame – do you want to be the one who tells him his family business isn’t family- run anymore? I mean, maybe you could get away with it? His favorite …
Fuck you.
But maybe you wouldn’t stay his favorite if you gave away the company? Look, we need a statement by six-thirty. So, you have to think, bullshit aside, who do you think, really, Dad would prefer?
Stop. Look, there’s something I have to say.
Tom, I’m not in the mood for fucking around—
Siobhan Roy, will you marry me?
Are you serious?
I love you. And I wanted to do something to make all this better. And I thought, while your dad’s still with us, wouldn’t that be nice? We can do a quick wedding.
What is it about my dad dying in a – a – sterile environment that screams ‘big romantic gesture’ to you?
It’s – it’s a horrible day. I thought this was something nice?
Tom, you can’t balance it out like that? I’m not gonna give you a – blowjob when your dog dies, yeah?
Look, no, fine. I misjudged it. I get it. Bad call.
No, I’m sorry. It’s fine. Look. Why don’t you do this again properly another time. Yeah? Let’s not have this as the moment?
No, exactly. This isn’t it. This didn’t happen. Abort.
Good.
Good.
But so you know, sure, whatever.
Yeah?
Sure. When it happens, yes. Such a shit show.
What?
My family.
Our family.
Hey hey hey! So I got the slippers!
Thank you, Greg. Just—
So you got the slippers. I guess that makes you Prince Charming?
I guess so.
So, you’re saying you want to fuck Marcia?
What? No. Why would you—?
That’s what you said—
No it isn’t—
You said you were Prince Charming.
No, you said that.
I’m kidding.
Uh-huh. How’s Logan?
Well I don’t think he’s going to be wearing those anytime soon.
Oh, shit. You know that he gave me a job?
What job?
I don’t know.
Okay.
Do you know when I start?
No obviously I don’t know, why would I know?
I don’t know, I guess I thought you all talked. I thought people might have been talking about me, what to do about me?
Yeah, no, everyone’s been talking about you the whole time.
I get it. Uh-huh.
Look, when you figure all that out, come in and see me – I’ll look after you, okay? Seriously.
Hey, cuz, you got the papers?
What – oh, dang! Roman, shit, I’m sorry, bro. I was so caught up in the, I asked the doorman and then, I got up and then I was thinking about your dad. That is   dumb.
Okay, we’re going to have to announce, where are we at?
While Dad is ill, the family proposes that Kendall should run the company, with Roman as COO.
I endorse this decision.
Okay. I’ll inform the committee of the family position, and board approval pending, we’ll announce. Congratulations, Kendall.
Yes, congratulations.
You should get some rest.
Look forward to working with you, bro.
Good luck. I have to say for the record, I personally believe this to be a total fucking disaster.
Okay, good. Kendall, listen, we need to talk—
Okay. There’s really no nice way to say this, but your dad has slit our throats and we’re now bleeding to death.
What is this?
We have a huge debt problem.
What are you—? No.
Three billion.
Fuck off. I’d know.
No one knows. Me and Frank.",0.45014423375519425,0.6603892471354741,0.30410281737120104,0.43667811757096875,0.30820762606051105,0.40550946157712203,0.33354628035941947,0.23413725679095548,0.5080505230893883,0.30740864087755865,0.14356139247180322,0.09558895149698052,0.17313918908341572,0.5661750649316952,0.46528663930411523,0.1794973174110055,0.35294115704555923,0.2035101531789853,0.13622475035775167
3,"What about Dad??
Yeah, your dad. Hence the debt.
What the— Gerri? What the fuck is going on? Was he secretly funding the war in Afghanistan – and paying LeBron James to lead the fucking infantry?
’95, Logan needed cash badly for the studio acquisition. He took out a loan, through the family holding company—
Where it’s hidden from view?
The company’s private and he knew that, besides Frank, none of the other board members would see what was happening. And he added the loan to the company’s already considerable debt.
Okay. Okay, we can deal.
It’s secured against Waystar stock – and when the stock hits one-thirty we’ve breached the covenant and they can pursue repayment in full. Which, if they went through on, would eviscerate us.
But they won’t, they’ll renegotiate, right?
Well. That depends.
Uh-huh.
The banks know the man they invested in can no longer function. As far as they’re concerned you’re just some guy. With hair. So, it’s a question. Do they stick or twist?
You’re making it quite fucking hard to savor this moment, Gerri.
Hey.
Got a cigarette?
Sure. I know it’s a weird time. But I have some weed if you want to smoke a bone?
I’ve just been appointed head of one the biggest media companies in the world and I’ve also been in rehab for drug addiction and it’s possible my dad might die at any second – so excuse me if I don’t get stoned out of my gourd with you right now, cuz. . But a cigarette would be great.
Is he going to be okay?
I don’t know.
We had hoped to see a response by now. There’s hope. But if we don’t see one soon, that’s not promising. What we do know is: he’s stable. So, if you want to grab some sleep, this is a good time.
Night, Dad. See you soon.
Stay strong, Dad. Keep fighting.
Dad, I think I’ve finally worked out who I am and what I’m doing with my life. There’s a job I want. It’s called President of the United States.
Hi. Sorry, Marcia, it’s just everyone’s going home and I don’t know where to go?
I don’t know, Greg – a hotel?
Can you get me the Waystar stock price at close last night please?
How is he?
Good. A little clearer. He tried to put on a sock. —
Hey. Are you awake?
Mom. Obviously I’m awake.
Are you stoned?
No! Obviously I’m not stoned. I haven’t had breakfast, what kind of monster do you think I am?
And you’ve got ideas, in case they want ideas?
Mom, don’t micromanage!
I’m not micromanaging. Have they given you an advance?
It’s my first day! And you kind of are micromanaging, Mom. Okay? ‘To the moon and back, bumblebee’ to you too.
Okay! Just wanted to say goodbye.
Have you looked at the numbers? Poor Ken. He’s like dysentery for the stock price. You’re walking into a burning barn.
Just paying – homage. What’s that? You miss me? I miss you too! Maybe we should arrange a date when ‘she’s’ not around.
Weird.
You’re weird! Okay!
Tom, listen, will you come with me?
Ugh. I gotta stand firm on this one, baby. It’s a huge-y, first morning stepping up?
Tell them you went to see the big boss. Please? C’mon.
Arghhhhhh! Don’t make me choose! It’s a man’s right not to choose.
Thirty seconds?
I’m getting the kids ready. Malaya, can you get him his cup?
Yeah, this is dumb but – bank call this morning. And I just wanted to ask—
What bank – our old joint account?
Um, no, no, Rava!   bank. ICBC who’ve apparently bankrolled the old man for years— I said?
Oh yeah, sorry. I’m just in a rush.
Yeah. Two minutes. Do I play hard-on or softcock? What’s your read?
Ken. Talk to your people. Malaya, it’s good to let him pour it himself, thanks.
You’re just, you’re always smart – and just … hard-on or softcock?
Ken, can’t we do this later? But no one likes a softcock. Iver! No!
What’s he doing? Let me: Hello! Ive – listen to me, you need to be cool with your sister. Alright? Remember your strategies?
We have to go. I can’t do this now, Ken? Let’s eat something sometime, yeah? Okay? I’m sorry. Why don’t you ask Roman?
Roman? Rava? C’mon.
Out of ten?
A seven.
You’re in decent shape. Little sloppy. But I can get you tight as a drum.
Okay well, I trust Pax. Pax says you’re the best.
Pax is the best.
He’s a prick. But he knows the best places. He’s the only person I trust on food. So I thought, I should trust him on, like, the opposite of food.
Only thing I’m gonna say, Roman. I take my shit seriously, that’s why I have the reputation I do, so you got to be on board for this regime.
Dude, no need for the speech, I’m down.
Five-thirty, every day is the regime.
Serious as cancer. Seriouser. Fucking— money cancer. I gotta check out. I’m rolling COO now.
Uh-huh.
 Operating Officer. Waystar Royco. If it operates, I chief it. Five-thirty is perfect.
That’s a.m., yeah?
Sure. Cool. Because the other five-thirty I’ll be – being an agent of change and you know, sacking people.
How’s that now?
A six?
Bullshit. I can go four more?
Argh! I think you popped something.
Hahahah. Nope. Señor, you’re done! —
Ask her to wait there.
Hey ‘she’s’ here!
It’s just something that happens. The morphine—
I know. I’m fine.
Is everything okay?
Lovely to see you, Siobhan. Tom?
I’m afraid I can’t stay.
We will settle any outstanding fees and non-disclosure agreement with her.
Really? She’s good—
It’s best.

Nothing. Staff. So! Good to see you.
Likewise. Look, I know you said he wasn’t great, but I was passing and I just
Oh that’s sweet. He’s not seeing people right now.
Sure, but I just thought I’d pop up even if he’s grumpy—?
It’s best you don’t.
It’s okay, I’ll take the earbashing!
I’m afraid that’s out of the question.
Um. I mean, could you just see and check he hasn’t, changed his mind?
Of course. Let me go and ask.
Hi? Shiv. Logan’s daughter? Thanks so much for everything by the way.
That’s quite alright.
Yeah well, much appreciated.
And how does he seem today?
Oh. You know.
Yeah, we heard all about the sock?
It’ll stabilize.
I know. I know it will. So, I’ve been thinking and I’ve got a new strategy for the call?
Uh-huh?
Hey. Don’t look so fucking nervous. It’s making me nervous.
I’m relaxed! It’s just maybe a little late considering the gravity and the need to get the relationship right.
Absolutely. The new strategy is really just a refinement of all this great work— It goes— Well the working title is: ‘fuck you’.
Uh-huh?
Hi, I have Mr Polk.
Uh-huh. What do you think?
I think – I may need a little more explanation before—
My dad’s a bastard. They need to know I’m a bastard too. Right?
Right but—
Great. Hey, Mr Polk?
Hi. Kendall, good to connect.
Likewise. Great. So? You wanna go?
Er, sure, or why don’t you go?
Um, well, we just wanted to make contact, given where we are.
Uh-huh. We are concerned.
Absolutely. Now obviously, look, the main thing is we just handle this very calmly because the last thing either of us want is for this rather private arrangement my father made to cause waves?
Oh absolutely.
But I guess the issue is, we owe you three-point-two billion.
Three-point-two-five.
Hey, I was rounding down!
We round up.
Secured against Waystar stock which is undergoing some temporary turbulence due to sector-wide factors. So – I guess what I’d like to know is what your position will be if we have a sustained breach of the stock price and we fall out of compliance with our debt covenant?
Okay, well, if the stock drops, we’re entitled to ask for repayment in full.
Uh-huh. Exactly. Technically. So what – what will we do here in, reality?
If it breaches one-thirty, you’ve broken the covenant and we will want repayment.
Right – I know. But really?
Seriously.
I get it. That’s your starting position, but we will want to restructure, and—
Look, here’s where I’m at. We’re not crazy about the media sector, we’re not crazy about how your father has treated our relationship. And our position is to seek recoupment.
Oh come on, man, fuck off. Hello?
Hi.
Yeah? C’mon. Real world. Can we start to negotiate?
That’s our position. If the stock drops below one-thirty, you’re in breach and we want our money back.
Fine, well let’s keep talking—
If you need to talk to me maybe it’s better if we go through an intermediary. I’m not a particular fan of foul language and I don’t like to be insulted. Thank you. Good morning.

Uggghhhh.
Give me a level?
Fuuuuuuuuck! That was brutal.
You were listening in?
Of course I was in! I’m COO.
Are they for real. Would they squeeze us?
Well obviously they could.
But why would they? They won’t, will they?
Relax, bro. New trainer. It’ll be okay.
No it fucking necessarily won’t. If this became public. We could nosedive. We could death spiral here.
Fine, dude, I was only trying to be nice, that was a fucking shit show and you handled it like a moron is the truth.
Fuck off.
Fuck you.
It’s fine. Just— We need, next time, to have a more considered strategy. I’ve got a portfolio of options?
I have a pitch?
Sorry, bunch of calls. Shiv is trying to reach you?
Finally entering the Death Star!
I can’t fucking believe it. Can you? Fucking – where does she get off?
Just can’t help feeling this is a little like my mom’s taking me to my first day at Death Star school. Such a sexy little mommy.
Greg Hirsch? I’m, I ah … believe I’m working here, as of today?
Okay? Umm— I have no – record of that.
Well I’ve definitely got a job, so?
I’m sure. I just don’t – have anything?
Okay. Um? Then, what, should I just head on in and have a mooch about?
Um, no.
Okay. So, what do you suggest?
Well what is your job title and who appointed you?
Um, job— Not entirely sure per se. And I was actually personally appointed by Mr Logan Roy? Can we call Tom? Tom um—
Last name?
His last— Weird, don’t think I ever, Tom, Boss Tom—? He’s in a relationship with my cousin, Shiv, Roy? Who’s my cousin? I mean I think that’s public knowledge. Although. Maybe, if you could keep that under your hat? Tom? Tom? Hey!
Okay. Greg? Greg Roy?
I’m actually a Hirsch, not a Roy. But my mom was a Roy. So, I’m basically a Roy in all but name. As it were.  
I’ll be two minutes, thanks.
No. No, Shiv— What?
It’s got weird, okay? I was over there and it’s gotten very weird.
How is he?
I don’t know, he might have put on a sock.
Well that’s good, right?
Or he might be lying there dead, I have no idea.
I can’t do this now, Shiv.
She thinks Marcia’s poisoning him.
I do not. Apparently, he doesn’t want to see us.
What, not including me?
Why would he say that?
Still pissed at you for not signing up to his corporate restructure? To make Marcia queen of the castle?
Well maybe  . Look did   see him over the weekend?
I heard he wasn’t up to seeing people?
No one’s seen him since we moved him home from the hospital on like Thursday?
Rome – you saw him, right?
Sure. For like five minutes. He was – he was pretty – you know, it wasn’t really ‘him’, him. There were tubes.
But after that? No one apart from Marcia has seen him for the better part of a week.
Four days is not a week.
Okay for the majority of the week. And we’re just accepting, the world is just accepting, this woman’s word that he put on a fucking sock?
We don’t want to rush the recovery.
Right, cos you like playing boss? Ken, we need to know what’s going on. Will you go over and see, please?
Should we take twenty?
Shiv, this is— I literally have something unmissable. Later, I’ll try later, okay?
Okay. Everything okay?
No, we’re on the brink of total corporate collapse.
Uh-huh. That figures. Call me if we go Lehman will you? I might like some of these chairs.
Hi, morning. Here to help fix the Death Star. ‘Grill on the exhaust vent, guys, grill on the exhaust vent!’
I’ve got your back. I told them this won’t be a habit.
My only concern would be, to brief this – meeting – is it a little – aggressive – for a temporary CEO?
That’s a good point?
Yeah well we’ve got a very aggressive drop in our share price, so I think that’s appropriate, good? So brief this wide and brief it fast, okay?
Good.
Great.
Good. And then I’ll be doing the Vaulter shoot and we’ll hopefully crystalize a new vibe, right?
Morning morning morning! Hey hey hey. My people. How’s it going? Great to see you all. You know my brother and I, CEO and COO? Gerri and Karolina?
Hey. I’m going to stand. Back. New trainer.
So. Just wanted to get the group together early in my tenure to say: Yo. You’re probably all wondering about my dad. He’s doing okay.
Yowch— .
We’re hoping for a full recovery.
He’s like a thousand percent better though. He’s like a bull in rhino hide.
Uh-huh. Slow and steady.
This morning he put on a sock. So.
That’s right. This morning he tried to put on a sock. And welcome to Tom Wambsgans who was managing resorts and is now sitting up with the grown-ups.
Hey—
So – what I want to discuss with you all this morning, is a new strategic vision. We have a great firm here. Multifaceted. Parks, cruises, et cetera. But at the heart, media: TV, movies, books and newspapers. And what we’re fighting for is eyeballs. Eyeballs we sell to, eyeballs we crate up and auction to advertizers. And bottom line: we’re losing. To monopolistic disruptors: Alphabet, Facebook.
Internet. Fucking game-changer, baby.
But we are still, just –   in a position to leverage our brands into something in the new landscape. But if we don’t, we’re gonna be like the biggest fucking horse trader in Detroit, 1909, okay? We need a more dynamic strategy – let’s call it, for the sake of clarity, the Strategy of a Thousand Lifeboats. Vaulter is a lifeboat. ATN Citizens is a lifeboat. There are no bad lifeboats.
VR could be a lifeboat?
VR’s a bubble. But yeah, no bad ideas.
Porn could be a lifeboat?
Except that. That’s a bad lifeboat. Hey – thanks, Rome. Look, this isn’t a brainstorm, all I’m saying: Everyone’s invited. I want all of you to be innovating, challenging, and bringing me a hundred lifeboats. Be bold, be disruptive! Okay? Because steady as she goes hits the iceberg?
Okay! Thanks, everybody! Woot woot!
He’s through there.
Hey Daniel. I understand you wanted to talk to me direct?
Yeah. It’s difficult with Joyce right now, so I thought this might be better.
Well, let’s get right to it, shall we? What happened? What do we say?
Okay, so I’ve been speaking to a friend who’s a lawyer and I’ve spoken to the PR people, at my publishers and I’m currently taking the view that I don’t want to comment as regards to anything.
Uh-huh. Fine. But between us, I don’t have time for a lot of – tofu. Was it your asshole online, were you looking to fuck around, what’s going on?
I’ve been advised not to say anything publicly.
Yeah but we’re not public and if this hack leaks Joyce is going to get fucked at a thousand miles an hour from every direction, so I need the facts?
The facts are – complicated and I can’t go into them right now. Everything isn’t as it seems. Is all I can say.
‘Everything isn’t as it seems’? That’s what I’m building my house on? What is that, your fucking Vegas magic show?
That’s it, for now, in terms of what I can say.
Okay well that’s a huge waste of my time, and I can’t speak for your wife but that’s a fucking treehouse of dildos right at the heart of this operation, so thanks a million and goodnight.
How’s your father? I was sorry to hear—
I have no fucking idea. Goodbye.
Great work, sir! Kudos! Here if you need a friendly ear, Lord Vader!
Just get shit moving at parks yeah, Tom? It’s stagnant. Shake that fucking tree, C3PO?
Shaking, bro! Shaking it big time!
Fiona— can you send flowers to Rava? Nice but, y’know, not ridiculous. They should smell like flowers, not desperation. And Fi, talk to Jess – I might want to throw a couple of items up on the internal – not a big deal, coupla TED Talks. And a documentary on the . First story. Because what are we, if not storytellers?
Hey, Captain.
Hey. And let’s get Carlo up in here. Those kitchens are a disaster. And maybe something fun. Not ping pong, but something, y’know. Throw some tags up in here. Not that. Skate park. Climb wall. None of these, right, but the essence? Talk to me.
Down three points.
Ugh. Okay.
There’s an AP headline: ‘CEO tells staff Waystar headed for iceberg’.
Not iceberg! Lifeboats! Lifeboats not iceberg. Jesus? Karolina?
That’s what we’re pushing.
The new regime shoot, Lawrence knows?
Yeah on that, ‘the new regime’? Forgive me for whoring in but shouldn’t I be in there as well?
Let’s not muddy it.
And in that equation, I’m the mud?
Okay, look I want to talk options to you, okay? I’ve got some thoughts that we’ve shared with Logan—
Interesting? Ideas that Dad didn’t want. Sounds appealing. But no, thanks.
Ken, these are modeled and thought through and—
And rejected. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m going for a walk, I need some perspective.
The thing about capitalism is, and I mean there are issues, but  . I mean this is a piece of shit chain on a stretch of nothing and this – this is like the most fucking delicious thing that anyone has ever tasted.
So, Stewy, listen, I could do with a read, from someone without a dog in the fight?
I wanted to ask you something too.
This is tight, this is absolutely just us okay? Because a leak kills me.
About Rava. For a pal.
Rava?
Yeah, it’s a mutual friend, and like, is it cool? Or are you still hankering for a wankering …  ?
I don’t have time for this – I mean, who, who’s asking? What?
I can’t say, but they wanted to know if it was an issue?
Like who? Fucking, Paul?
Fine, if you’re asking I’m assuming it is an issue.
Yeah well, look, we’re separated. Whatever. Free agents.
I get it. I’m having another. If you eat it fast enough you can actually burn off the calories. It’s a loophole.
So. When I took over, found out Dad took out a huge loan, a decade ago, secret, through the holding company?
Seriously?
Secured against the family’s stake in the public firm.
Oh fuck.
Yeah. Now the stock is getting ready to breach and the bank are—
Yeah I saw that price, brutal. Who’s the bank? Sounds like they have your dick strapped to the clapper of the opening bell.
I need a read.
Well, number one, you boost the price.
Uh-huh. Well I am trying. How’s it going to play for us to refinance elsewhere?
Honestly? Not great. ‘Why won’t your original bank step up?’ Not good. People don’t love the sector. They don’t love the firm, it’s ramshackle is the view, the fucking everything shop – and they don’t love— the situation. It’s tough.
Uh-huh.
Plus the options for sounding it out? Without word spreading? Horrible. Ugh. I’m so disgusting. One thing occurs, just blue-sky. Wouldn’t happen in a million years, but. What about we came in, my outfit, took the whole thing off the family’s hands?
Uh-huh? Well, obviously no, fuck off, how dare you, I’m so insulted, et cetera.
Of course. But you and Roman and Shiv. Do you all want to be in it, forever? You could all get fucking fucking, rich. Do anything. You can get into tech, Shiv can do consultancy,   Roman can, I don’t know, DJ for douchebags as they kill hookers in St Barts.
Uh-huh. Thanks. It’s Paul, right? Rava – it’s Paul?
Okay! I am open for business!
And can I get the senior team together tomorrow for a reorientation? I’m shaking the tree, folks! Excuse me, Greg, are you kidding?
Oh hey.
Greg, forgive me, but are we talking to each other on the poop deck of a majestic schooner? . No? Then why the fuck are you wearing a pair of deck shoes?
Oh, yeah? My credit card got maxed out? I’m living in a youth hostel
Jesus. How, squalid. Dude, are you carrying dogshit?
No, it’s – it’s free, right? Is that cool? I mean, I don’t want to be melodramatic but – my body is growing weak, due to – lack of sustenance.
But in a – dog-poop baggy?

Greg, that’s disgusting.
Not really. They don’t pre-poop them? They’re just bags, really. It’s just a mental barrier.
Pair of cap-toe Oxfords. Crockett & Jones. ASAP. Lucinda, can you figure out where we might put the talented Mr Greg? Flash! 
Can I get you to do a kind of a – a like an arm wrestle, on the top there?
So. How does it feel, man?
Feels pretty good.
Fastest falling stock on the exchange? One-three-four? Yeah?
Well, you know, I probably overpaid for you, so. Gonna hurt us.
I didn’t sign up for the toilet. I signed up for Logan Roy, major investment, global reach, not – Scrappy Doo and his thousand holey lifeboats.
Okay. Little cheesy? But ‘Vaulter’. How about, Kendall, would you like vault, like over Mr Yee here?
No.
No.
Fine. Okay. Then maybe just – bros? Hanging? Bros pose. Let’s go with the bros. ‘These are the bros who knows.’
I tell you what I wonder about you? Could you even open a restaurant? Could you actually fucking, do anything? Or are you just a name?
Good! How about another idea – ‘verbal gymnastics’? Can you give me a ‘business conversation pose’?
They got plenty. Make it work. Tell him to take thirty minutes’ worth of solo Lawrence shots and then delete them all.
Kendall. Sandy Furness is here.
What do you mean?
He’s here. In the building. In our offices.
The fuck? Who let him in?
Security wasn’t— And people were becoming aware … He’s been very nice to everyone.
He can’t do that. Fucking Pepsi doesn’t just drop in to see Coke. Put him where no one can see him. South Tank. I’ll be right there.
Sharks are circling.
How are we looking?
Down two more points.
Hey.
Hey. Nathaniel.
So. How’ve you been?
Busy.
Uh-huh. Right. So? Is this—?
It’s work.
Okay. Of course.
What?!
Fine. Just a simple work meeting on the bed of a four-star hotel room. If you don’t want a cookie, Shiv, don’t go down the cookie aisle?
It’s just private is all. The matter in hand.
Uh-huh, right? And, so how’s it going working with Joyce, the long glass of tepid water from Albany?
Good. How about you with that poor man’s Fidel Castro? The senior senator from the state of 1975.
Zing!
Look. I just wondered if you could do me a favor?
Do I owe you a favor?
Sure. Because I deigned to date you?
You  ?!
And I thought we were going to be friends?
Sure I want to be friends.
I wondered if you could run a background check on someone?
That seems like it might cause some ethical issues because there’s a world where my guy and your gal end up in the mud, wrestling for the democratic nomination and—
It’s not political.
Oh, right?
I need background on someone off the record. Marcia.
Marcia … the wicked stepmother?
Occurred to me a few years too late, I really don’t know much about her. Just due diligence. Okay?
Well, I do know a really horrible guy. And he’s incredibly expensive.
Well, thank you. That sounds perfect. Can it all go through you?
Uh-huh. ‘Yes my lady.’ ‘Deigned’? Have you  the women I dated after you?
Those women dated you   you dated me. It was like, ‘Oh I guess he must have   …’
Mr Furness! Kind of you to drop by.
Not at all. I just came to say how sorry I was to hear about your dad.
Really appreciate it. That’s kind.
I know we’ve had our battles but he was one of the great visionaries of his generation—
Well, it’s kind of you to do it in person when you could have just called, so. Thank you.
I hope I didn’t send the birds a-tweeting. What with all the uncertainty and whatnot.
We’ll make sure people know it’s just friendly.
Great. And will you give your dad my best? Tell him I dropped by?
Sure. Maybe when that news is a little less likely to kill him. Okay well I appreciate this, you’re looking great.
Thank you. I eat babies. And just to say, if I can give you any advice. I’m just watching the wheels nowadays so, you want to run anything by me, as an honest broker, use me. A mentor.
That is a very kind offer.
There’s probably a million options with our two firms? Swaps, acquisitions, cooperative interactions, smart stuff only a young man like you can conceive of.
Oh, Sandy, you’ve been pretty smart. Smarter than the regulators, anyway.
Tell you what was smart, Vaulter. I don’t care what the wise apples say.
Jess, would you take Mr Furness down.
Look at you. Right in the eye of the raging storm and cool as a cucumber. Stay strong. Stay in touch.
What happened?
He said I was dead in the water without him and tried to finger-bang me.
What did you say?
I told him I’d rather eat my own shit.
You heard?
What?
It’s over, bro. One-two-nine-point-eight. Clap hands, we’re fucked. I think if this was a movie, the office would now blow up.
You know sometimes you leave the party and you wonder what everyone’s saying about you?
With me it’s usually – ‘Who was that maniac who put a watermelon on his dick?’
I know. I know what they say about me. That. That’s how much people don’t trust me.
Hey, it’s me too, man. Don’t leave me out.
I mean the truth is – we, we call their bluff which may not be a bluff, and the debt becomes public and – we lose control. Or we get the stock up, which we – can’t, we can’t magic that. Or we pay the bank back. Which means – you know, to realize that much cash? Stock sell- down. Which is horrible. There are no good options.
Can I suggest something?
Uh-huh.
Can I suggest we all take our shirts off?
Umm? Ken?
You know I beat off in my office earlier?
You didn’t actually though?
You know, we can be a pair of little fucking worms wriggling around in here – do what the button-down fuckheads say. No offense, Gerri.
Please. Go ahead. Masturbate your way out of this.
Seriously, man. They could write an algorithm to run this place. But that’s not the answer. Break shit up. Disrupt. Yeah?
Ken? Tell him to put his shirt on.
I don’t fucking know. I don’t know. Okay. Look, so worst position, we sell down the stock. We survive.
Or. What about, next-wave shit. Prop-co op-co. Turn group finance into a profit centre?
Or go financial engineering. Full Enron?
Hey if you’re gonna shit on every idea, I got places I could be.
I mean to get some cash in the holding company – sell the old outdoor ads? And for the share price, parks and cruises?
Those are very profitable pieces of the jigsaw—
Poor Tom. Boo-hoo.
I mean sure but – what are we doing with them? Does that make a negative a positive?
Maybe we cut a title or two, from physical production. Newspaper- wise? Online only?
That’s a twenty-million solution to a billion-dollar problem.
But it’s the right direction of travel. That feels right.
Look, if you want stuff that will work for the price: lay-offs.
Yum yum, blood! See – shirt-off shit?
I guess it could be a package? Lay-offs, sell-offs.
Structured retreat?
Well, yeah, but with a philosophy?
I guess we should ask – or tell—
The sock-meister?
I mean we should at least  , right?
Could I just check – are these ironic at all?
Er, how do you mean?
I just— They look normal, but I’ve never— This isn’t my usual domain and I need them for normal so I just wanted to check, they aren’t ironical in any way or anything are they?
Hey, guys! Thank you so much for doing this here. I’m sorry. And – actually— can’t stay long.
Apparently goes for us too. Aunt Marcia won’t let us see Grandpa, right, kids?
Kendall!
Is he okay?
He’s improving. He’s really improving.
Great! Because I probably need to let him know something.
But he’s resting. I’m sorry. It’s not a good time.
Oh, okay – well, it’s just when my assistant called …  ?
She spoke with Joan, not me.
C’mon, kids.
Is this his request? The solitary confinement?
I’m absolutely guided by what he wants.
Well let him know, will you, I wanted to talk to him, keep him abreast of moves?
If you like you can tell me, and I’ll pass it on.
It’s complicated.
Oh. Of course. Over my head.
We’re – we’re retreating. Tactically, and—
I’m sure you’re doing the right thing.
She’s being protective.
Right. She probably has his brain in a jar and she’s working all night on his signature. For the new will. You get my flowers?
Tell Fiona, thank you.
Listen, how about you let the nanny take the kids.
Uh-huh …  ?
Come back to the old place and we probably need to—
Yeah—?
Y’know— negotiate.
You want to ‘negotiate’?
Yes. Like animals negotiate. Tough.
Have dinner with me? Tonight.
Hey buddy. Come on. First meeting with the senior management cadre.
Uh-huh? Great. Great stuff.
I’m gonna bad sheriff it, you cool to play the fuck-sock?
Uh-huh? As in? —
I was looking through employee emails, which by the way is completely legal, but does my breath smell? Honestly?
Er. No. No, I mean it smells of – breath but—
Too much drift in parks. Gotta shake that tree. I might punchbag you a little, that cool?
Oh sure. As in?
Morning, people. New day. Great to see you all. So, I’ve got a number of new approaches, that I’d like to run through. But first, some of you I know, some no, and I just want to get a feel for the team and let you get a feel for me? So, to kick off. Here’s a question. Here we are, off in the theme-park division, but tell me: If you could do anything, professionally, work anywhere, what would that be? — Yeah, go ahead. Can you intro?
Um, Brad Kilmartin, global marketing.
Hey Brad, good to meet you, man. So? Dream gig?
Um. I guess I’ve always wanted to work towards the creative sector in terms of— I could see myself, using my marketing skillset at a movie studio?
Sexy! I’m going to do you a favor, Brad. You’re fired. Follow the dream, man.
Heh. I mean—?
I’m sorry. This is the best division of the best company in the world. If you’re not happy, it’s probably best you move on. . If we aren’t feeling it, how can we get millions of American families to? Huh?
Are you serious? Jesus Christ?
So, now, you— Yeah ‘family man’? We all know why you’re here. You silver-spoon piece of shit?
Hey?
So, you bringing any ideas to the table or are you an empty fucking vessel?
Um – um. Ideas? Petting zoo?
Excuse me?
Like a scaled version, the biggest petting— It wouldn’t be pathetic,
Are you arguing from anecdotal? Because you better have numbers to back that up or I will tie your lanky limbs into a bow and turn you into a fuckable pretzel. Excuse me?
Okay, well, it’s hard. Well, I guess if Connor’s flying in?
He’s actually a pretty great guy.
So. Stewy. You know how everyone hates you?
Well, no. That’s not something I’m aware of, no.
Oh sure, they do. Private equity, getting your meat hooks in, chiseling your profit? Like a vampire locust fuck.
What is this? If I wanted to be insulted, I’d have coffee with my daughter.
I’ve had an idea. How about instead of taking us over, you give me four billion dollars? I stay boss. You stop raiding shitty companies for scraps. You  in a blue-chip corporation. One that is currently undervalued because of some unfounded concerns about its leadership, i.e. Little Lord Shareplunge here? The story twists. Happy ending.
Okay, full disclosure: I have a hangover. Bigger than normal. So, let’s do this the way we did back in the day – head into the boardroom with some something-something and bash out a few ideas?
Not for me.
Uh-huh. How would you feel if I …?
Really? Man?
What can I say. I’m Bacchus. I’m Type A.
Are you done?
No. Obviously – I don’t generally take minority stakes in public companies?
You’re a parasite. How about for once you make things bigger. With an old pal? Are you done?
Yes. I couldn’t begin to even think about this. But if I could. To sell it, I’d need it to be voting stock?
As long as the family maintain control.
Well, effective control. And I’d need a board seat.
I’d force it on you, dude. For the optics. Shit-hot new CEO has some hot-shit new money for investment? New generation. I keep the debt out of the news. Sisters are doing it for themselves?
I’m not necessarily totally opposed to this notion.
That’s right and luckily I speak Stewy. And that’s Stewy for ‘I have a raging hard-on for this.’
How much?
And listen, tell Paul to stick to jerking off at the opera. Rava’s still my wife.
You background-checked her?
No need to tell Ken.
Is that legal?
You don’t need to know—
I mean could anyone do that on … anyone?
First husband, you remember – Lebanese businessman. They had the high life in Paris, lot of parties, lot of pols and writers and also lot of slimeballs and fixers and shitbags and arms dealers. Oil guys—
And further back?
Further back is complicated. No leads.
Right. Is that—?
It’s weird.
It is apparently a little weird and there are two possibilities. Either, she came from kind of nowhere, Tripoli, Lebanon, turns up in Paris as a publishing assistant aged thirty-one and marries this guy, fine—
Or?
A clean-up job. Someone sometime tidied loose ends, did a deep- clean, bleached Google. Tied everything off.
Why would she do that?
Well – either, she didn’t, and you’re paranoid, or – there’s another possibility, and I don’t know what it is?
Hello. Hello, everybody?
Yeah, hi. You know Connor, Logan’s firstborn son.
Hi, Shiv, c’mon let’s …
And this is Tom, my, partner. And between them they are over twelve feet of we would like to see him please?
Good morning.
Are you going to force entry? Is that it?
Sorry I didn’t realize this would be framed so aggressively – I mean this is just normal. Let’s de-escalate?
He simply isn’t up to visitors.
Is this about me signing some pieces of paper or—
Shiv, please. It’s a very difficult—
Oh, the fucking waterworks now is it?
Siobhan?
I can’t believe you would try to stop me seeing my father!
I can’t believe you would try against his wishes!
Well it is nice to see you.
And how long are you in town?
I think she’s really upset but it comes out as anger. Pretty much everything comes out as anger with her. You look well at least.
She does look well. You also look well. Everyone looks well. Apart from Logan.
Dad—? How are you feeling? So, I wanted to come in. Um. Tom and I are engaged and—?
Where’s Frisk …?
The … You mean the dog?
Uh-huh? I love you.
I love you too, Dad. Mom took her to Italy. Yeah?
Everything okay?
Uh-huh. Thank you. He’s looking better.
The morning is not usually a good time. The morphine, he gets confused. He doesn’t want you all to see him when he’s not himself?
Uh-huh. Sure. He wasn’t himself.
No. And, Shiv—
Yes?
I’m a private person. Not all of us are born into good ease.
Right?
If you want to know anything about me, you can just ask me and I will tell you.
I just thought we were doing our plan, man. Shirts-off shit?
Retreat? Rome, this is a million times better, right? —
Good afternoon.
Thanks for making time for us, Mr Polk.
Not at all. And we’ve been looking at the terms we can offer and I think you’ve seen what we put together?
It’s a very brutal structure?
Well, these are the terms we think we can offer right now.
I mean the margin you’re making, you might even say you were— Well I mean blackmail is an ugly word. But so is getting goat-fucked.
I think we should keep things professional, don’t you?
Uh-huh. Sure. And professionally, we’re going to repay.
As in?
We’re good. Everything’s golden. We don’t need you. This can all stay private and I’ll be looking elsewhere for a banking partner as we go supersonic. Goodbye.
Um—
And fuck you.
I think, champagne for my friend?
Ken? I can have water with you.
No, it’s cool. I’ll taste it on your tongue later.
Bit creepy?
Not suave?
No. Nope. Have you been trying that a lot?
Oh, I thought that was— No wonder all the women I date keep throwing up in their soup.
So – is this the Stewy money we’re celebrating, I saw the news?
Well I’m not saying I’m the man but if there was a man, hypothetically, he might look a lot like me. I’ve solved the debt issue, with private equity money.
Well I’m very happy for you.
Yeah, well, the thing is, all of that, it’s made me think about – everything? And you know, here’s where I’m at: I love you.
Okay. Well. Thank you. Noted.
And – so—?
Ken?
C’mon?
Well, okay. I’m not sure I love you.
Yeah you do.
Fuck you!
Look. You want us to live separately, we don’t know why right now, but you say you do. Now that makes me unhappy. On the other hand, you claim – though of course I don’t believe you – that us being together will make you unhappy. So. One of us is going to be unhappy. I just don’t see why it has to be me?
Wow, I cannot argue with that logic. No, actually I can. Because it’s the argument of a psychopath.
At least let’s flip for it?
We are not breaking up.
We fucking are. I’ll do what I want.
Nope.
Yes.
B-man!
Nice office.
From up here, all the fucking ants, you can almost imagine they’re people, right?
So, you wanna work out down here or? We can parkour it or take my car to the park?
Well here’s the thing, Brex, I can’t run today because my back has been fucked since Monday.
‘Fucked’ how?
I assume you’re insured? I mean, I’m doing big shit, big big shit every day and so like losing even a quarter of a percent of my operating capacity, that has million- dollar implications. And I’m thinking, maybe, test case, I throw three or four dozen white-shoe lawyers at you and see what it would be like to actually physically destroy someone?
Dude. I don’t know what happened, but I’m sure I can fix it.
Fuck you – look at you, are you okay? No. I’m just saying, you need to take this seriously?
Sure. Look – what— It could be a trapped nerve but most likely it’s just a muscle pull. You want to lie down? I’m trained in deep tissue. Here.

4,"Fuck you!
Yeah?
Fuck you.
Yeah?
Fuck you!
Okay. I have to go.
What about Malaya, can’t she—?
Iverson will freak out.
Rava. Why don’t we just do it all. Back together?
Let’s talk later.
That was nice, right?
Nevertheless.
What? You know I’m clean.
Oh I know. Sure.
And everything else, that was just the rest of that?
Look. I don’t know. Maybe it’s seeing you doing so well at the— I don’t know, it’s like you’re moving on and that makes me feel okay about moving on too?
Hey, no. That’s bullshit. I’m not moving on. Rava? It all comes down to work and family. That’s all I want. That’s the secret sauce.
I got a lawyer. He’s nice. Let’s make it all really really nice, yeah?
Marcia. Everything alright?
Your father would like to see you.
It gives us options – I’m not going to finance you at the same levels as ATN – Lawrence, but it’s a start. The rest is up to you— It went to ATN already. Sorry, I gave them that— We’ll make it official soon enough.
Hey. Look at you. Sitting up. Fucking watching the news!
Huh. Getting better.
It’s good to see you. Probably your first bit of downtime since the womb, right? You understand, after you went down, the stock tanked. You should be flattered, I guess. We had some pretty shitty options. But I found us a private equity solution so. I tried consulting but— Karolina says there’s positive analyst noise. People like the shape of this. We’re at thirty-six percent. Effective control. Plus a war chest to make some moves. We’re – we’re in good shape, Dad. Keep getting better. I got this.
Yafuginidit.
Dad, can I get you something?
Okay, that’s right – along the edge. Good! That’s good!
Don’t patronize me. Walking’s not good. It’s fucking normal.
I’m not, that is good, Mr Logan!
I need a sit-down! Chair!
Come on. If you are not well enough for the charity dinner maybe I go with this handsome young man?
Okay and this is trickier, this is the proprioception.
Turn it off! It’s like being inside a fucking commercial.
You look good.
Uh-huh. Thank you.
Gracey? I’m trying to clean my fucking teeth here?
Did any more PRs get back about wearing my new pieces to the ball?
I don’t know. They’re not my fucking private army of little dollies I get to dress. I’ll chase, okay? This is why it doesn’t work when you stay over. There are five bathrooms. Why are you in this one? And now I want to fart and I’m not, I’m physically not farting because you’re here? I’m feeling kind of oppressed? —
So, I’m going to speak to Connor to confirm table arrangements? We’re hosting basically the same table as last year plus Joyce and Daniel, that okay?
I didn’t go last year, Shiv?
Yeah you did. Remember? Racist Belgian GS guy and his wife who tried to kill herself?
Shiv? I   I’d remember our first Roy Endowment Creative New York Ball together! I was crunching parks numbers like gravel granola?
Yeah?
Honey, growing up I used to look at the pictures of the RECNY in Mom’s old  s?
Uh-huh?
And now – a little boy from St Paul is going. With the most beautiful gal in the world!
Ugh. Fuck.
What is it?
It’s happened. It’s the inevitable asshole. Okay, where did you get it?
It’s quite a haunting image, isn’t it? The eye almost seems to follow you around the room?
What is this?
You know your future senator? Apparently, this is her husband’s asshole.
What? Fuck off. Can you prove that? How will you prove that? Do assholes have fingerprints?
He posted it himself. With the words, ‘Check out my asshole.’ On a website called Filthy Rich. For married people who want to fuck around.
Has everyone got it?
Um – just us I believe right now. Leak to ATN. My pal thought I’d be intrigued.
Okay, well, bring it on.
Umm feisty!
They’re not going to run with it?
Way below my level, Shiv. But my guess is, why not, a little? It’s dirty, it’s weird. And it’s evidence of precisely the sort of disgusting liberal metro butt-love that makes our viewership angry enough to buy pharmaceuticals.
It’s not even a story, Roman. Her  ? That’s— It’s unfair.
Oh it’s worse than that, Shiv, I’d say, it’s – it’s – malicious.
Days from a special election? I mean, we’re ahead but this could – this could have an effect.
Uh-huh. Would you actually say, it’s like we’re ‘partisan surrogates subverting the democractic process which underpins our whole way of life’.
Okay, well thanks for the heads-up and fuck you very much.
Yeah, well, I hate to be the bearer of bad news! —  – 
What do we call it? ‘An intimate body part’?
Sounds like his dick?
Or just – ‘his anus’?
‘Anus’ – at breakfast? That’s a juice-dropper. Lot of people gonna spill a lot of OJ.
‘A very private part of his body’?
Makes it sound like he has an internal VIP area. She needs to get more sleep. You sleeping okay, Karen? Yeah? You sleeping on your face? I’m kidding you look great.
How do I look?
F-I-E. Fuckable in an emergency, Mark. —
Hey, Rava? Did you make a decision yet? Well, no it’s not CEO arm-meat. Rava, this is a big night for me. I’m making Dad’s Wasp Trap speech. Fine. I just kind of assumed your ‘hopefully’ was a yes. Yes you said ‘hopefully’. I remember— I’m not trying to be anything. I know you, ‘hopefully’ implied a yes, you know what a big deal this is for the family but if you’ve changed your mind that’s cool just don’t try to tell me …
Just days before New York special senate election, Joyce Miller, the hotly tipped Democratic candidate, is red-faced this morning after the hack on blue-chip-affair website FilthyRich-dot-com. Not only was Miller’s husband apparently hunting for extramarital liaisons online, it appears he went on to share photos of a  . Now it’s seven-thirty a.m., Anna joins us with her Wall Street Breakdown.
Ugh.
Thanks, Karen. Yesterday’s market continued to move into positive territory. The S&P technology index led the way higher, up tw0-point- five-five percent. The index notched its best day in six months and is up nearly twenty percent on the year. The S&P 500 is having a harder time of it but still remains up seven percent on the year. Adding to positive sentiment was second-quarter GDP numbers that showed the US economy maintained a brisk pace of growth, at a two-point-eight percent annual rate, despite concern over a dip in the construction sector.
Connor, I’m just wondering if we should slide Joyce and Daniel and me off our table, and out of the front row, and the heat?
Well if I move Joyce plus two that’s a huge hole at table three. Right in the Chairman’s Golden Circle. Do you want a gaping hole there? It’s like having the front teeth knocked out of Waystar?
And she’s coming through the service entrance.
Can you put this in an email?
Can you write it down? I’m sorry, it’s a crisis day.
Yeah well I haven’t finalized the name for the signature cocktails, so I know how you feel!
Right and I don’t know if she’s bringing Daniel or— That seat’s in limbo. That’s a limbo seat, okay? I’ll confirm closer to the time.
It’s tomorrow, Shiv? You’re murdering me right now, you know that?
Listen, thanks for jumping on this whole thing. With Marcia busy with Dad.
Well that’s very kind of you to say. And it’s cool. No sweat whatsoever.
God help us! Right, Stephanie! What genius event planning are you going to dazzle me with today?
Okay, well I wanted to show you, this is how I would generally display the seating plan? —
Uh-huh. Good. No, I don’t like that at all.
Right? And this would be how we’ll set up for the step-and-repeat?
Yes, we’ll need to revisit all this. It doesn’t work for me. Nope. You know what Napoleon called Marshal Ney, Stephanie?
No.
‘The bravest of the brave’. The bravest of the brave. That’s what we have to be here, people!
How was LA?
Great. They’re all fucking nuts, but great. Can you get on to Lance about my speech? Can we get one of the late-night guys to cook me up a bit?
A bit?
A selection of jokes and riffs.
You’re going to do a joke?
What does that mean? I was fucking king of the  . Kicked their distribution into shape too.
Kendall, I’ve pushed everything this morning because—
Who’s that in my dad’s suite?
Because your dad wants to see you? I’m guessing you didn’t know?
No, I didn’t know. But— Great news. I’m delighted. Right? Did you know?
No but it’s great.
Oh sure. Shouldn’t he have told you? Listen, I’ll just get straight and go and see the old – fucking— Goat.
Tough morning?
Yup. Yes. A lot of things he told me were the case – about this – now the transcript of the messages has leaked. They were maybe not the case.
Uh-huh. Sure. Okay.
What’s everyone doing in there?
Um, just – basically, strategizing?
Fuck.
Ugh. You see—?
Oh. Urgh.
You’ve seen the annotated transcript?
It’s not a transcript it’s a chat log. Date stamp. IP address. Not much wiggle room.

Hey!
Uh-huh.
He’s let you down, Joyce. He’s a dog. He’s filth. He’s scum and I wish he was dead.
He’d actually like to come in later and say sorry to everyone?
Okay. Well, that would be nice?
Shiv? Shall we?
So, we need to issue a statement and as planned just move the conversation back to your issues.
I want to get into this. Why I’m getting this crap.
Sure, but just tracking the cycle for this, what people will be asking is: It’s an ass pic, is he gay?
He’s not gay. The full chat I think proves right, that, that he probably likes—
This is just for background.
He likes a finger up his – anus and that’s why he posted—
A straight finger – a hetero finger?
Yes.
Nothing else?
What do you mean—?
Anything else? In terms of what went up there? Any surprises? Because first it’s a finger, then it’s a fist, then it’s a dildo shaped like Richard Nixon?
Fuck this. A man wouldn’t get this. Let’s say that? Why can’t I say that? A straight white man’s wife does this, does he get hurt?
Agreed. But for us, now, this isn’t going away. I think you need to talk to your husband.
It isn’t going away because ATN won’t let it go away. So maybe you should talk to your father?
I don’t like ‘intimate body part’. Uh-huh. Your call, Eva. She tried to regulate every fucking sector in New York as AG, turns out she can’t regulate her own husband. If we don’t call out this frigid little – phony who will?
Hey, Dad! What’s all this?
I didn’t know you were coming in? Did Gerri?
Do I need permission?
Hey, screw you! You okay? Are you well enough to be in? Did you use the chair?
Chair?
The wheelchair, Dad.
Just making sure you weren’t selling any more of the company from under me.
Oh, you wanna get into that? You put a hole in us by taking on a shitload of debt, Pop? But – look, this is great to see you. So what’s the plan? Do you want to schedule a catch-up every so – often, so you can, you know, keep up to date?
You’re lining up acquisitions, is that right?
Good. Because, you know, things are cooking. Fucking, brave new world.
Cuh. Nothing new under the sun. I was informed, you’re doing my ball speech, is that correct?
I was told you suggested it?
Yeah I was told the mailman’s prick tasted of toffee apple, but I didn’t believe him.
What, you don’t want me to—
Good luck to you. The Sad Sack Wasp Trap. One time a year anyone fucking likes us. Knock yourself out.
You’ll be missed. We’ll raise a glass. You sure you’re okay? Why don’t you get a briefing and head home? Yeah?
Uh-huh.
Gerri?!
I need to take a leak. Where’s the guy?
You should have got the private bathroom put in.
Waste of money. And close the blinds in there. I’m not a fucking zoo animal to be watched.
So. Dad’s back.
Back where, what? Back in the chair?
Back to check in. I hope he’s okay. It’s fast, right? But good.
‘Good’? You’d love it if his brain fell out the back of his head!
Roman, Jesus, man, no. I’m just scared in case he—
You’re scared in case he’s going to push you out and your plans for you – know, Uber for news, Facebook for cats? Fucking open-plan office you on a dance platform jerking off idea gloop into – ‘think boxes’—
Got to go.
Roman.
Frank?
Good morning.
Well correction – it’s not a good morning from my POV because you’re here, and I hate you.
Oh, come on, kid.
What the fuck is going on?
Your dad asked me to come back.
The fucking, the – the Weasel Prevails. That would be a good name for your autobiography – if they did books by, jerks.
So I’ve come back.
You’re pathetic.
He apologized.
Sure, man. He didn’t apologize when he hit our au pair with a car.
He wants me to show you the ropes.
It was her fault, for being too short he said.
And here he comes. Bill. ‘The Best Boss That Ever Lived’. It’s like Mandela fucked Santa and he gave birth to  .
Have you heard about Logan? He came in apparently.
Uh-huh, I knew, but I couldn’t say. Come on, you genial old shitbag, get in here already, before it’s time for   to retire.
Tom. Sorry about all that.
No problem, Bill! I just hope I can eventually inspire similar affection. This is Greg. New guy I took under my wing when I started—
I’m actually—
He doesn’t need your life story, Greg.
So, thanks for everything. But listen, before I do the final photo. There’s a thing I need to mention. Just us.
So. Look, I’ve turned off the Wi-Fi, and this is air-gapped. I’m creating a Word document for you, and then I’m going to print it because I don’t want anything in my handwriting.
I think   been watching a few too many spy movies since they retired, eh, Bill?
Hahahaha! Yeah! Maybe! This is the number of a set of storage files in the depository. And they’re— The subject is— It’s something, that— It’s not a big deal. But it – it just needs to be handled. And you’re in the family. So, this – is the name of the legal office that is the intermediary? This is the person outside the firm we used as a firewall to deal with blowback on NDAs?
Uh-huh?
It’s   a big deal, Tom.
Right. But – what is it Bill?
Okay. Look, you’ve got two viable options. I can tell you everything, and that’s fine. Or, I can not tell you. And you can not know – and you stay clean out of the – death pit. And that’s fine too.
Uh-huh?
So, the nice news is, both ways, everything’s fine? Just keep the nuclear rods cool, and nothing’s going to blow.
Well that’s – that’s a really reassuring image, Bill.
Photographer’s ready …
Terrific! Thanks, Kelly!
Okay. You need to tell Dad to back the fuck off.
Hello? Did we have something scheduled?
He’s rehired Frank to babysit me and I don’t need a babysitter! Especially one I don’t get to fuck.
Seriously? Frank?
Yeah. I mean, you’re CEO, can he even do that?
It’s, I don’t— It’s a question.
You need to tell him to butt out. We’re running the show. Go back to bed, eat some soup. Get better.
Look. Relax. The dinosaur’s having one last roar at the meteor before it wipes him out. It’s, expected.
And what do I do with Frank?
I’ll talk to Frank. But, look, you’re doing a great job.
Thank you. Thank you. That’s good to hear. Because it’s a big job.
I know it, bro. Tell me about it.
If you want I could help you – we could tag-team it on Dad’s speech – at the Sad Sack Wasp Trap?
Um, I guess, I mean it is a CEO thing, so, I think maybe, I mean I have a whole thing prepared, with jokes and so—
You’re doing a joke? Fine. Who you taking?
No one. Rava’s busy.
Doesn’t want to.
So, I’ll probably— Maybe I’ll fly solo?
What? How does that look? CEO can’t get an ugly sister to go to the ball?
Sure. I’ll take something. A head on a stick. A cauliflower with lipstick. I mean know who I’d like to take? Anna Newman. From ATN?
Oh yeah, I’d fuck that in a minute. Ask her.
Not cool. I’m her boss.
What a pathetic beta-cuck. ‘Would it be “cool”? Cos I got something secret in my pants, would it be okay to show please, or is that a trigger-warning, baby?’
You’re a walking fucking lawsuit.
No. I’m honest, I’m just like, ‘Yeah I like your face, can I come on your face?’ which is why I am drowning in pussy and you’re not even fucking your wife. I’m sorry. Them’s the facts.
No thank you please leave me alone thank you!
So. Look, I want you to call off your dogs.
Uh-huh.
Because this obsession with Joyce – it’s out of line. It’s sitting very high in your half-hour.
Uh-huh?
And it’s vindictive and it’s – it’s actually it’s bad for democracy.
Uh-huh.
So? Are you going to respond?
I think it’s important to remember that I’m not the one taking pictures of my asshole here.
Are you running this because you think my dad likes this shit?
Oh he doesn’t put that kind of pressure on his people.
Look. Okay. We are where we are. If I could get you some nasty little tidbits on other folks I know, could you ramp this down?
We’re not the only ones running this. It’s a hugely popular story.
But you’re leading it, Eva. You had a ten-minute sexpert segment on how to keep your man happy in bed, on a  ?
Okay. You’ve said your piece and I’ve listened so—
No. I’m saying, as her strategist, this level of attack starts to reflect on your professional judgment and you should think about the future because this is the old world and things will change – in the world, one day.
You know I wouldn’t let any other strategist in the building let alone in my office?
Well, I’m very grateful.
So when we’re talking professional judgment? Good to bear in mind that only you’re here because your name matches the one carved on the building?
So, you’ve done this for a few old— vegetables?
And we step along, good—
Did you do Ollie Sirrett? After his?
I don’t really discuss that sort of thing.
Uh-huh. And how many of us go back to normal?
I like to think I can get you better and better every day.
Bullshit. Here’s a question. One to keep— lock. Can they test me? Can they, get a doctor in to see if I’m—
Impaired?
A sad case. Have you heard of that?
I’m a rehabilitation specialist, Mr Roy. Not a lawyer.
Morning? Personal first, then – the corporal.
Corporate? Um. Okay. Well, personal, nothing much. Pre-ball piece. We got profiles of endowment recipients and that’s all great? And one little
Say!
‘Kendall Roy will give the traditional address at the RECNY charity ball tonight in a sign that even after recovery from his stroke Logan Roy is intending to wind down from public duties.’
Where did they get that? Who gave them that?
I don’t know.
Well here’s an idea: Find out, or find some other prick to pay you a million a fucking year.
Handling the ball, it’s just not a big deal for me, that’s the thing that’s so nice. It is not a big deal.
Winding down. Winding fucking down? I’m winding up!
I had six hundred quail that were not sourced to my liking and I just had to make the call?
Uh-huh?
So I just did it. I trashed six hundred quail. No biggie. Sourced six hundred others. Done.
Uh-huh.
It’s just funny. Being in charge? Y’know when I think, how – years ago, I’d be at the table between you and Mom? And we’d look down and there’d be the mayor – and all the names of old New York and you’d whisper, in my ear – ‘that Astor used to be that and he ran this, till he snafued that and he’s porking her, she’s a slut and’ – it was just a – very lovely time.
Your mom loved all that. Fucking Wasp Trap.
What I was actually wondering about the Foundation, since I’m doing all this organizing, is would it be a good way in for me?
To?
To national affairs? Like maybe in your absence. I could do the speech – not Kendall?
I’ve jerked him around enough.
Or. Maybe— What would you think if I took over a little on the Foundation? Could we pivot it away from sick kids and contemporary dance towards tax reform and the abolition of the US postal service?
Uh-huh?
You know, to be frank, everyone’s dancing anyway, and a lot of charities cater for – sad sacks – and god knows I love them – but what about lending a hand to stimulate free enterprise.
Stewy is here – I’ve got him South Tank in case you want to keep it on the DL …?
Hey? So, why, Frank?
Oh, what no biggie. Why’d I come back? Thirty years he’s probably fired me forty times.
He never wrote the press release before?
I don’t know. Big house, Ken. Big mower. Mower needs gas.
Money? Any fuckhead can turn a few million a year, Frank.
Look. Here’s where I ended up. I could be humiliated in public – fired – or I could be humiliated in private and come back. I should have told him to fuck off but it’s my life. I’m kind of invested in the narrative? —
Kendall, I wondered if I could grab five—
Uh-huh?
Yeah it’s something – something you don’t know about and you maybe probably don’t want to know about?
You know what my dad used to say? He’d say he loved all his employees. But he particularly loved the guys who ate the shit for him and he never even knew it?
Got it. Then excuse me while I get myself a knife, a fork and a side salad.
Hey, man! So I heard your dad was back in?
Yup, he made it in. Which we were all delighted about—
And what’s the story?
No he’s great. Likes to remind us he’s still alive! Great to get his take. But he needs  . Dad? Hey. Just talking about you.
Uh-huh?
Mr Roy. Logan. It’s great to see you.
So you’re the little guy who owns such a big chunk of me?
Hahahaha.
Excuse me barging in. Just, Gerri told me you have a meet with Opalite Data later? Just to say, I like it, buy it. Okay, Ken?
Okay? Good thought. I’ll come find you and we can discuss.
Sure. But if I don’t see you. I want it.

I want us into data mining. Buy it.
Dad, it’s a really flooded sector. Lot of hustlers. Lots of bullshit. It’s a gold rush.
Yeah. And who wants gold? Make them an offer they get excited about. Make them an offer they tell their wives about that night.
Great outdated sexism, Dad, but I’m sure you’re all over the data mining.
Matched with an aged wife.
You okay. Dad, should I get someone? You shouldn’t be here, you know.
Fine. I just … need a piss.
Great, well thanks for sharing, old guy! Still recovering.
And like technically – without being too reductive, Ken, like, who is in charge, right now?
Me. I am. Legally and effectively.
Okay. Thank you, Rick. Thanks for that. Really useful.
So listen, Greg. It seems I have been exposed to a virus.
Oh, right?
It’s a deadly virus. And now I’m fucked, forever.
That sounds – bad?
It is bad. And I kind of need to share it – but anyone I talk to, I effectively kill. That’s the death pit, Greg. Take a look.
Right, I just don’t know if I’ll like it in the, the death pit?
You’re family.
It’s – complicated?
Kind of. But not really. For a number of years, there was an unofficial company policy on our cruise lines that if a serious criminal incident took place we would, if possible, sail not home, but to a Caribbean or South American port where there were, so to speak, ‘friendly authorities’ and we could minimize the incident to avoid negative PR.
Incidents like—?
Theft, sexual assault, rape, murder.
Uh-huh. The bad ones.
There’s hundreds here. Head of cruises himself, Lester used to go on ‘entertainment tours’ meeting the dancers and extending the contracts of the ones who’d suck him off. Everyone we could we paid off. But there’s emails, there’s correspondence. This could all blow. Who knows if the NDAs will hold— it’s a time bomb.
So what are you going to do?
I don’t know! And anyone I ask for advice, I make complicit. Because if you know about this, you should tell! But you can’t! Or you spread the virus!
Okay, Ken. Why don’t you grab the Opalite Data material and we can take a view?
Well as I explained, Dad, I think they’re kind of snake oil salesmen. They’re the people who – you buy a refrigerator and their algorithm is sending you thirty ads for more fridges? Great algo!
Yeah well, you’re the business genius who sold me out to this fucker, so I’d love Stewart’s thoughts.
I’ll get Jess to—
It’s thirty fucking seconds’ walk away, son?
Jess? Has anyone—?
Your dad popped in for like two minutes?
What the Jesus fuck!
So I think we’re buying. Good with you, Stewart?
You’re the boss.
All good? And, Stewy, you going to the Sad Sack Wasp Trap tonight?
He means the RECNY Ball.
Oh, sure, I’ll be there. Will I see you there?
Nah, I’m afraid—
I’ll be there. I thought I might as well go since I’m paying for it anyway.
You’re sure it was him?
You think a lot of people come in here and take a piss?
Maybe someone spilt something?
Yeah maybe the massive fucking ice sculpture I forgot about melted? It’s urine.
This isn’t a false flag is it? Did you piss on your own floor?
Why the fuck are you looking like that. What if people knew? Gerri, you have to talk to him.
What do you want me to say?
Well first, let him know where to go peepee and poopoo.
He came  . He was   to Stewy. I mean, what’s he going to do next? Start jizzing in my coffee? Take a dump on my iPad?
He’s still in recovery mode.
If he thinks he’s okay to come back, he should talk to you, Gerri, and the nominating committee and set a date, right?
Well, technically but I guess it’s a gray area because—
He says he’s coming tonight.
You’re kidding?
Okay, well that’s a concern, because obviously, with major investors and press on hand?
What if he freaks out? What if he falls asleep in his soup? What if he starts shouting – racist comments.
Just another Saturday night, baby.
We have a fiduciary duty not to let the company look – nuts?
And what did you do, Kendall – when he did this?
What did I do?
Yeah, how did you respond?
I – I didn’t want to humiliate him. We need a game plan. Frank? Gerri, you need to tell him, he’s sick, he can’t run the company. Yeah?
I just hope this seating plan holds. If it does, look out Middle East cos I can fix anything!
This would be the third shot I’ve given you in a month?
He feels he needs to be there.
You’re only meant to have three a year. No wonder you’re not sleeping. You’re risking long-term nerve damage and—
Jab. Not jabber. Shut up and shoot up.
Now this is just a nice offer vis-à-vis the event tonight, if any jewelry at all catches your eye this is all designed by Grace O’Hare, exciting new designer, and it’s just a complimentary offer via our PRs to wear anything that works for you to the RECNY Ball tonight. Come on, pick something and let’s get going … It all suits you. Everything suits you. Just take some.
Sweetheart? Can I talk to you for a minute? I could really do with some advice. Have you got time?
Uh-huh.
So, look, I don’t want to get you into all this but – well, Bill told me as part of the handover – where some of the bodies are buried? But they’re not very well-buried bodies. And they’re not really bodies. They’re zombies, that might rise up from the dead at any moment. And kill me.
As in—?
I don’t— Maybe you don’t want to know?
Uh-huh?
But I’m worried if it does comes out – and it’s kind of bound to come out – and it’s, while I’m in charge – I’m dead. Because I know and I’m not doing anything. But if I do do something, I’ll have to, you know, do something? I’d like to, not carry the can, obviously, but also do the right thing? Maybe?
And what’s the right thing?
What I’m thinking is, as soon as possible, a press conference. Get everyone in – tell all the top execs and law guys. And we go public. Outside investigation. Disinfectant of sunlight. Pin the rap on a tight group of naughty, rotten apples?
Sounds brave.
Uh-huh. Right. And that’s – good?
Look, can we circle back? I need to talk to Joyce.
So, I missed your call, what’s the news?
Yeah. Look, I know it feels huge to us but it started the day as item three, end of day, I think it will be item five.
They’re not going to drop it?
I can’t stop it. Your husband’s asshole is the gift that just keeps on shitting. We just have to hunker down, keep focussed, ride the cycle.
Or, other option, I go after them?
I don’t think that’s a good play.
Is that you saying that as you? Or as the daughter of a media mogul?
It’s me saying that.
Uh-huh. And so – how can we – how can we stop this?
Well – definite end, just as a fact, to kill this for now and ‘the future’ is if you leave him?
Uh-huh? Okay.
But I can’t advise on that? So, see you – both – later?
Yeah. Looking forward to it.
I don’t know if I can do this.
You can.   Fuck them.
Excuse me, what the hell is this?
A glass?
Every glass should be at three o’clock.   is nothing.  is something. Check every glass! Unbelievable.
Why is no one standing in that half of the room?
Oh god. The room is growing lopsided! Let’s lead them – like sheep. Willa – lead them over, corral them!
Hey, guys – there’s plenty of room over here.
Come and enjoy the space, guys! Acres!
The signature cocktail is too avant-garde! The servers are creating bottlenecks! They put pesto in the gin! It’s a disaster! There’s no flow! The evening is congealing, Stephanie! There’s no flow!
Yeah my dad’s first wife thought she was gonna, you know, empty the ghettos and get everyone into ballet when they started this thing. So patronizing.
Heh, right.
A couple of kids who got into New York City Ballet still send us cards at Christmas though so I guess that’s nice or whatever?
Wow, that’s nice.
Yeah it’s dumb, but it’s cool.
Okay, change of plan. We’re going in the front.
So how many presidents you had in this contraption, buddy?
Three, sir. Two former, one serving.
Who’d you like?
I heard good things of them all, sir.
Uh-huh, very fucking diplomatic.
I was going to use the, ahem, back entrance but I thought, maybe not tonight?
Good. Good. Good. Is that too wry? About our good works? I mean is it, like, snitty?
Well there’s all this? Like three pages of – about you, and the family, and the good works and the big hearts, and on and   and  .
Excusing you but I didn’t ask for editorial comment— And then it’s into Kendall. Okay. And he’s all blah blah blah – hold on, pal. What’s that? ‘Surprise Logan retirement announcement’??
Yeah that came through late. He said he’d freelance that?
Where you sitting, Greg? In the basement? Or out by the dumpsters? Tell me you’re at least in this time zone?
Hey! Tom, so, look, I hear you’re thinking about holding a little press conference?
You know about that—?
I don’t know anything.
Right, it’s just I think—
Tom, you need to shut up. This isn’t the time to get your conscience out and shout ‘Oooh, look at me, I cannot tell a lie, I’m a good little boy, look at my ding-dong.’ Okay?
I don’t think that’s a fair characterization of—
Do you know who the sin-cake eater was?
Um, no—?
He’d come to the funeral, and he’d eat the little cakes they laid out on the corpse, he ate up all the sins, and you know what, the sin-cake eater was well paid, and so long as there was another one who came along when he died, everything worked out. So this may not be the best situation but there are harder jobs. And you get a fuckload of cake.
And can I ask where you heard about this?
Tom, it’s tough to have to tell you this way but I’m in a sexual relationship with your mother. And she talks in her sleep.
Hey, Dad? Dad?
Ugh?
How you going? Yeah. Just wanted to check in on something? Just to check you were – aware of Kendall announcing your retirement this evening, I mean I’m sure you were but I wanted to triple-check?
What?
Yeah, is that – right?
No.
No? Is it a mistake? Cos Kendall’s going to read it, it’s on the teleprompter.
Change of plan. Kendall’s not speaking. I’m speaking.
The butter’s too cold! The butter’s all fucked, you’re fuckwads and you’ve fucked it! There are rolls ripping apart out there as we speak. It’s like granite! I’m a laughing stock!
Connor, there are always some issues when you serve this many people but I think, on the whole, it’s going very well.
Complacent! You’re fired!
Hey, you lump of fucking turducken.
Hi, Tom?
Did you squeal?
What?
Did you bitch me out, pig-man?
As in?
You bleated – about the press conference?
No.
Yes you did.
No I did not.
Yes you did, you filthy piece of shit. I should drag you into the kitchen and have them boil you until you’re sterile— Oh my god, Greg, did you just touch me?
Tom, I’m sorry but your spittle was actually like—
This is extraordinary. What are we going to do about this? Are these assaults going to be ongoing?
No.
And you’re telling me you didn’t do it?
I promise. I swear to god.
Then who the fuck did, Greg? Ah? Because I only told you?
Dad, I don’t want to shit-talk Kendall. ‘He’s not up to the job’— but I think I speak for everyone when I say it’s great to see you back.
Thanks, son.
But – one thing, and I don’t mind, it’s fine. But I wanted to say – Frank is what to me now?
He’s – Vice Chairman and your general advisor.
But why?
Why? What’s the situation with the park numbers?
How do you mean—?
Attendance is good but occupied-room nights are down on last year. Why?
Well, I’ll press Tom? What? I’ve been waiting for Tom to get his feet fully under the table — The guy is a bit of a flake is the truth. But leave it with me. When are you coming back in again?
You need to soak up Frank’s experience.
Uh-huh, but what does that mean?
It means do what he fucking tells you.
So sorry about the butter, guys.
Nice one, bro.
What?
Fucking the talent?
Hey, come on, what?
ATN are fucking me, you’re fucking ATN. It’s a literal fucking clusterfuck.
Everything okay?
Yes. I’m having a lovely time, thanks.
Is there anything I can do to put you at ease?
I’m having a wonderful time, really.
And you’d tell me if you weren’t?
I’m a reporter, I report. Absolutely.
So sorry about the butter.
What?
And just so you know, apparently, Dad’s going to do the speech, so late change of plan. Hope that’s ‘cool’?
Excuse me?
Yeah he just said. So. I guess that’s put a spoke in quite a few wheels!
Con. He’s in no fit state. Is he okay? I mean this could be, does he know where he is?
Oh he knows. Uh-huh.
There’s like, pension funds, there’s analysts, there’s major investors. This is fucking high-risk. Gerri?!
Dad wants to talk? Gerri?!
Okay. I did not know that.
When he opens his mouth anything could come out. Drool, anti- Semitism, fucking silk handkerchiefs tied together. If he fucks up publicly we have a major problem. You need to talk to him.
You good?
I’m good.
Great. Good luck tonight. You’re gonna knock it out of the park.
Thank you.
Hi, don’t mean to intrude? Hold on, buddy. Thanks?
It’s still early, Rome?
Well thank you, Grace, you delightful speaking timepiece.
Dude, if you like her that much why don’t you ask for her fucking number?
Rome?
You clearly want to, right? Do you want to give him your number?
Yeah I want to give him my number.
Dude, ask for her fucking number?
Can I – get your number?
Okay! Here we go! Okay? Thank you, everyone’s happy!
Good luck. Bon chance! Best foot forward. You can do it! Good luck. Nervous?
Not too bad.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I had a thing, with the butter. But, seems to be okay. Where you from?
Er Bushwick?
Indeed. Yes indeed. Well, wonderful. Great effort. Connor Roy. People have a lot of preconceptions about me too. It’s difficult, I mean, not like— I imagine everything is for you but—
Right.
I actually have an idea that social equality could be effected by a total eradication of federal support. Just people like you and I, doing it together, fighting it out, without, all the – bullshit, that’s holding you back. You know?
Okay. This is me.
Great. Break a leg, my friend!
So I’m sorry to hear your friend was getting crucified all day?
Oh you heard that? I’m surprised you heard that, given that it had so little to do with you.
Good job tonight, Con! Best event of the fall.
Terrific evening. You really showed it to those cystic fibrosis fuckheads.
It’s all about the charity, not about me, folks.
We fucking nailed it! Everyone! You’re all amazing and I love you! Stephanie. My rock. We did it. We just landed this thing on the Hudson.
Ladies and gentlemen. It gives me   pleasure to introduce to you, on this most auspicious of occasions— In a change to advertized attractions. The man, the legend, Logan Roy!
You okay? Keep going. Just get to Dan. Then pretend to talk.
Oooh! Elvis! I thought we were getting the support act! He’s kind of milking the walk?
There’s forty billion dollars of market cap waiting to see if he can make it. What? If he falls, I could lose several of my houses .
Now? Come on. Come on! Nearly there.
He’s retiring? He’s a lizard?
I’m officially announcing … I’m back. You better believe, I’m back! Full time. Better than ever!
Great news! Right.
It’s great.
Get me out of here!
And what was that?
Went well, I thought.
What the fuck is wrong with you, Dad?
I see you. I spied you fucking out, son. Don’t try that again.
I have no fucking idea what you—
Retire me? Shoot me like a dog in the street. I heard about your little speech?
What do you— I was going to do one fucking joke about how you’d never retire?
Bullshit.
Why didn’t you just talk to me? I’ve no idea where this has come from, Dad?
Huh.
You’re okay, Dad. You’re okay.
You did well tonight … Connor. I’m proud of you.
You know. You pull off a night like this and you realize, people are just people.
Uh-huh?
‘I can no longer obey,’ Dad. ‘I have tasted command and I cannot give it up.’ A certain artillery cadet by the name of N. Bonaparte?
There you are!
Hail to the chief, Dad?
Hey. So look, Anna. Can I just ask? Is there – something – going on here?
As in?
Like, I don’t know, is there – an atmosphere, did I say something to offend you?
This has been a lovely evening. I was so glad to come.
Uh-huh. Thank you. So am I crazy? I feel like I’m on a date with an app, like there’s invisible bubble wrap?
Look. Off the record? Off-off? You seem like a nice guy. Eva told me to come.
Well asked. I asked her to just, ask your people.
It’s fine. I’m just seeing someone. But you’re the boss.
What? No I’m not that guy? Okay?
Yeah. Sure, no. I mean you actually are that guy, right now but – sure.
What did she say, Eva?
Nothing. To make sure you had a ‘really good time’.
Was she joking?
Eva? Oh sure. Okay? And I’d prefer it if you didn’t say anything?

Please don’t. Okay?
Sure.
Dude? This is our charity. How much a plate? You’ve got to get at least a blowjob. That’s the law.
That’s not the law.
Well it’s the ethical code. I hate to say this, but she has behaved rather unethically here.
We might be looking for a new Wall Street correspondent.
Good kid. Smart move. Keep talking.
I aim to please, ma’am.
Hey, Shiv. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Well I’m glad you thought it went well. I’m glad Twitter is so positive about the joke. No I’m sure it was a great evening. You did great. Everything is great. Her opinion is we’re okay.
Oh great, well in that case I’ll sleep soundly tonight. I mean it is only an opinion and you know the thing about opinions? Everyone’s got one. In that respect they’re like—
God. AP photos. Some people just don’t know how to wear jewelry.
Did you tell him to call?
Well, you did it.
Hey hey hey!
Uh-huh uh-huh. You’re late.
Well, like ten minutes, Grandpa? Happy Thanksgiving!

5,"No, sir … That’s actually anti-racist and also racist. Which is kind of cool but also really not cool? So, shall we grab lunch then hit the road? I gots the old rumblin’ tum.
No. Let’s go before it snows.
Ken? I think your dad might ‘appreciate your input’? He’s thinking big?
Oh, look out, folks, here come the ‘top minds’!
Hey, what you got cooking?
Really no need, gentlemen, Frank wanted to fold you in. But you should know probably my thinking in terms of – things.
There’s a potential opportunity for some acquisitions and consolidation.
Packet of local TV stations.
Local TV stations?
No one watches TV, Dad.
TV is where the majority of people get their news. And more people watch local than any other kind.
Yeah. But not really.
Maybe raw numbers, but the demographic? I mean for Waystar, is it a good ‘look’?
‘I don’t know, Kendall, you tell me.’

You know there’s this fancy new business theory, son? It’s called, ‘make more than you spend and you’re King Cunt’.
These channels, they’re not exactly cash fountains?
We like the scaling opportunities and the bargaining power.
I like putting the knife in the rival canoes. We’re the number-five media conglomerate in the world …
Yeah, I’ll get the T-shirt made.
Time to be number one.
That’s great but it’s unrealistic.
And I want to look at a broadcast network. And I want to see what other news operations we can sweep up.
Oh, Dad! C’mon?
Why shouldn’t we do all the news?
Do all the news? Well, Kim Jong Pop, because that’s not how things work in this country.
You sure do love telling people what to think, don’t you?
Fuck off. People come to us because we don’t try to sell them on anything. No packet of fucking bleeding-heart United Nations Volvo gender-bender horseshit.
The strategy eventually would be that we’d support a range of news brand perspectives.
Bud. Miller. Corona. Becks. All the different beers are owned by one big bastard who wants to get you drunk.
The politics on this would be horrible. Justice, FCC. Antitrust. We’d be tied up for years—
Nah. TV’s getting fucked, it’s gotta consolidate.
Look. Fine. I don’t want to make this a thing – you like local TV, great, you’re smart. I just hope it doesn’t mean we can’t pursue diversification and innovation. The Biggest Turkey in the World
Of course. India. China. You know how many fucking people there are in Indonesia?
What? Sure. Who doesn’t. More than you’d think. A billion?
Roman, you’re a moron. I think you should get into all that for us, Kendall.
What?
Get back into that, over there. Vice-President Global and Digital. Out of Dubai, wherever. China, India.
Excuse me, are you serious?
Meeting’s over.
Dad? Dad! Dad! What are you doing? Are you okay? Stop, Dad!
Yeah. The long drive. I get it. Mom had a friend who was scared of flying? He actually died in a traffic accident. But he was on a bike. And heavy meds. So. But this is cool. We got this whole time to – talk about – whatever. Business. The future. Corporate structures? Or just – let the country music play?
No music. No chatter. Keep your mind on the driving.
Sorry, got a kind of an important meeting. Nothing to worry about! Just – work. So yeah, couldn’t sleep.
Yeah nor me.
Sometimes I thought I was asleep and I actually wasn’t. It was weird. But you looked like—
It’s not a competition, Tom. I was up till three-forty, actually, writing pros and cons of sticking with Joyce, on her PAC, and you were snoring like a hog. So?
Well my nasal strip fell off. What’s this?
The prenup.
Ooooh! Okay!
Yeah?
Yeah. It means it’s really happening? We’re getting married!
That’s a very romantic way of looking at a prenup.
You know what, I’m not even going to look at this. Just show me where to sign.
You have to look at it, Tom.
Honestly, honey, I’m not from money, you’re from money. I don’t want to look at it. I hereby comply.
I don’t want you to  . That’s not the basis for a healthy relationship.
Fine. Look, as a gesture of my love to you, I will have my lawyer look at it. But I want you to know, in my head I already signed it.
I hear your father is much better.
Yeah it’s great.
Just to say though. Down in the ‘Pig Sty’ we’re all huge fans of your stuff. The innovation.
Thank you. Like what?
Oh everything. Data storage. The digital guys I know were all popping. Not to sound cheap but the whole breakfast cereals thing?
The bircher muesli was off the hook. That shit was crazy. Were you involved with that?
So, I met the guy. ‘Sylvester’.
‘Sylvester’. And did you use a fake name?
I think Sylvester is his real name.
What? Who’s called Sylvester? Really?
Yeah. He’s – he’s just— We pay him. He’s normal, he’s legit. He’s on the record. He says it’s easy.
Okay. Because I’m worried. You know, after the Iranian revolution, the students taped back together the shredded documents from the US embassy?
He asked a lot about the digital deep-clean? And I said that was good. Emails and servers. Nice and general. Not specific. But that of course we’d wiped the specifics.
Great. But how does this part work?
We shred. Then some guys come in when we’re quiet, he suggests right away, tomorrow, Thanksgiving and ‘it’s possible’ they’ll dispose of all the unwanted material.
It’s ‘possible’?
They definitely will. We just need someone to shred and to sign out the materials from the document depository – and that name could – that’s a name that could draw heat, were things to go – bad?
Well I can’t do it obviously. Thanksgiving. Could – you?
Er. I mean. I could? It’s just. It’s— You know, the task in hand is a little—
No, sure. Absolutely.
You want someone you can trust. But who is, not ‘expendable’. That would be horrible.
Oh no sure. Totally. I get it.
Hey, buddy. What’s up? Am I going to see you in the office any time soon?
Uh, not that soon. I’m driving down from—
Uh-huh. So what’s your ETA?
About twelve hours? I’m in Canada.
Excuse me? Canada? Canada with the healthcare and the ennui? Why’s that, cock-sock?
Yeah. I’m just bringing my grandpa—
Greg, fuck your grandpa.
You’re actually on speakerphone, Tom?
Well I shouldn’t be, Greg.
Sure got it.
Sorry, Grandpa! Well, hurry up, Greg, yeah? I have a job for you. And I’m being nice cos I’m on speakerphone but if I wasn’t on speakerphone I’d be being, shall we say, somewhat less agreeable? Yeah?
It’s good. Rough and tumble, Grandpa. I call him a dicky too. He’s actually pretty lonely and afraid, I guess. Like we all are.
Fuck you.
Yeah, you can’t do it can you?
Fuck you. You fucking, piece of shit.
You’re a piece of shit, come on, come on, you fucking dirtbag.
No! What the fuck. I think I’ve made it pretty fucking clear I need a modicum of space once every twenty-four hours! Fucking come in, my heart rate’s dropping like a stone anyway!
It’s your brother, he absolutely insisted. I didn’t know …
Is it true? About the coffee?
What, Dad? Sure. He just kept pouring. It just went everywhere. It was like he didn’t even see?
Jesus. He’s not right.
Local TV, local news? Here’s a local news story for you: ‘Elderly Local Man Doesn’t Notice He’s Getting Butt-Fucked By Google’.
I am NOT going back to Shanghai. I   the company when he was sick.
Did you hear the way he talked to me? That was the tone, whole time I was at the studio.
 fucking patronizing.
Who knows how many people live in Indonesia? I mean who even cares? Fuck Indonesia. It sounds like a medical condition.
When I— When one of us eventually takes over what’s going to be left?
How many people live up your ass, Father Dickmas?
The firm’s being run by a compulsive hoarder. It’s this big old ugly spooky house and he’s all caked up in the middle covered in fucking moldy newspapers, with the local news blaring, feeding Wonder Bread to raccoons.
You gonna do something.
I should.
You should. And the only way he’ll respect you is if you try to destroy him. Because in your position, that’s exactly what he would try to do.
Yeah. I can’t do that.
Obviously. So. Have fun in Shanghai!
Hello?
Oh wow!?
You look incredible. Special delivery!
Oh? Enormous flowers!
So?
Oh what, sure. Yeah.
Heh. Yeah. Heh. So, yeah, work’s going okay I would say. Yep, working hard.
One of the symptoms of an approaching nervous breakdown is the belief that one’s work is ever so important. Bertrand Russell.
Ha! Yes indeed. Yes, sir. But I tell you what I sometimes think – I know you’re very busy with the ranch and your readings and research but I sometimes wonder if you wouldn’t, one day be interested in like, giving up your seat on the board and just –  out. Like really relaxing you know?
Life is nothing but a competition to be the criminal rather than the victim. Bertrand Russell.
Uh-huh. I don’t have a Bertrand Russell quote because this is the first time I’ve heard of him. But I do have this quote: ‘Just putting it out there.’ It’s a good quote. I don’t know who said it.
So, tomorrow’s going to be great. Just a fun day relaxing with family. So I thought we should spend a few hours tonight discussing strategy, key alliances, the whole ‘invisible chess game’?
Oh, Con. I’m really sorry I can’t do anything tonight, I have a prior engagement.
Oh? Right. No problem. I just thought we had two nights, tonight and tomorrow?
I thought it was tomorrow and Friday?
Hm. Well could I have tonight as well, on top?
You can have it however you want it, kiddo! No, no, I’m kidding.
I mean, considering the misunderstanding can’t you cancel?
Well no, my – friend’s – a theater producer so? But you’ve got me all day tomorrow? And I’ve got you.
I think I just licked an air freshener. I thought it was candy. Do you think I’ll be okay?
How was it? How are you feeling?
Great.
So I have some news. Ewan is definitely coming, for Thanksgiving.
Ewan? Bullshit. Why?
Why? Well, he asked and said he’d like to come and I said yes.
You’re a pretty good liar.
It’s not good to have rifts in the family.
It’s not a rift. He just lives in Canada. And is a prick.
Uh-huh? How long since you spoke?
We send him a fucking birthday card don’t we? Not that I get any thanks. Think I need some physical therapy.
Of course.
The other kind. The Joy of Painting .
Look, you didn’t come back out of love for my father. So I guess what I wanted to ask was, what’s your plan?
Ever heard of loyalty?
Sure, wasn’t he one of the Seven Dwarves? No? A rapper. Was he a part of the Wu-Tang Clan? I’m sorry, I gave everyone Thanksgiving off. So, look, Dad’s not well, right? The business decisions are not cogent, they’re old-man shit. But that’s his call in some ways you know, but he pissed on my fucking floor? What if that got out? No one wants to say it, but we can because we basically love him, but he’s not okay. What about he wakes up one night fucking calls – Bezos and sells us out for a dollar? I just want what’s for the best.
Ken, I’m an old man.
He’s sick. Do you think the real Logan would want us to stand by and watch while he throws it all away?
Talk more.
Happy Thanksgiving, Mom. I know. I’m sorry. But we’ll see you at Christmas— or New Year. Maybe. But listen, thanks. Thanks for all that. No, I understand. Love you too.
Is there a problem?
No. No. It’s fine.
What is it?
Nothing, it’s just my lawyer says—
You mean your mom says?
She’s a highly respected attorney in the Twin Cities?
Sure, so what did your mom say?
She says the prenup is a little bit—
What?
‘Unconscionable’. I mean, that’s a legal term. I don’t care—
Fine. We’ll change it. Guess I just got Wambsganned, huh?
What can I say? She’s a hard-ass.
I tell you what is unconscionable. Cranberry sauce in a can.
I know, but your dad loves it!
So, there’s Roman, me, you, who’d stand up against him—
Don’t you have the pods?
The pods? Three grams of coffee in six grams of packaging? The inventor of those is basically Oppenheimer.
Ewan is never there so he won’t vote.
And even if he did, he hates Dad. How about Gerri?
Gerri? You’re dreaming. But I think – yeah, if – there’s no Ewan. Looking at the numbers, yes, you know Asha, Stewy, Roman, Lawrence you can firm up a couple of doubters. Yep – it’s definitely possible?
No CEO has ever survived a successful vote of no confidence, right?
You know, honestly, I think he might be looking for a way out?
That’s the spirit, killer. So, are we doing this?
Don’t ask me. He’s your father.
I’d be doing it for him. Carla! Where do we keep the fucking coffee beans? Skeleton staff.
I mean, do we even need to have one?
Yes, my mom and dad’s divorce was horrible. I just don’t want more … mess.
But we’re not going to divorce.
Uh-huh? You write a will, don’t you? Even though you’re not expecting to die?
I am expecting to die, Shiv. Sorry, maybe I should have mentioned that when we first started dating.
Happy Thanksgiving!
Happy Thanksgiving!
Ewan. Happy Thanksgiving! I’m so happy you came! He was asking for you when he was in the hospital.
Must have been the drugs.
He’s tough I know. You’re a pair of noble stags who can’t stop butting heads! Thank you for driving him down, Greg.
Are you kidding? Great to spend some quality hours with you Gramps! And how, may I ask, is Logan?
Oh you know. But together, Ewan, we will cheer him, yes?
Well, that’s not up to me.
The Thursday box office is trickling in and it’s  . How is that possible?
It’s possible because, people are idiots.
Happy Thanksgiving to my favorite stepmom. Remember. No tongues, Mom!
Welcome. Grace. Isla. —
It’s just depressing is all.
Rome, that’s why it’s hard to succeed – because how can geniuses, like us, figure out what morons, like people, will like?
Yeah. You, me and Roman? So long as everything else went our way? Vote of no confidence and kaboom.
It doesn’t need to be horrible, right?
Sure. He tells the world he’s decided, following his illness, it’s time to step down?
I mean it will be fucking horrible.
Hey. What are you up to?
Nothing.
Are you smoking weed?
No.
Do you want to?
No.
Watch the door.
No … I shouldn’t. Tom might want me to—
Come on. Don’t be rude. It’s the weak sauce, Greg.
Frank. Thank you for coming.
Not at all. Kids are in Denver anyway. We’re meant to alternate, but it never seems to be my year. I like to think it’s all about the stuffing.
For Dad.
Thank you. Kendall – say hello to your uncle Ewan.
Ewan’s here? Uncle Ewan?
Yes. Isn’t that nice.
Oh my god! This is so strong.
Is it?
Oh yeah. You think I smoke schwag? Yeah, you’re gonna be  high.
Oh,  . No.
Fuck!
What?
. Now they think it’s going to set a fucking record for Thanksgiving box office.
That’s us, right? That’s ours?
It’s not a good film, Greg. When he was at the studio, he tried to stop it. But he got overruled by the jerkies.
Oh right. Although I guess it has made Roman and everyone more money?
That’s not the point.
No, of course. No?
There you are!
Need more booze!
Happy Thanksgiving.
How was the trip? I hear Grandpa Ewan’s quite the character?
Oh, he’s okay. Eventually I found an economics podcast he liked to shout at.
Uh-huh uh-huh. So listen. I actually need you to go into the office today. That cool?
Could it wait till tomorrow because I just drove all the way from …
Has to be today.
But no one will be there?
Exactly. Greg. Listen to me. What do you want to do?
I was hoping to just eat some turkey and …
With your life? Where do you want to be in five years’ time? What are your hopes?
I haven’t really …
What are your fears?
Well, I mean, you don’t mean just spiders … you mean—
You and I have had our bumps, Greg. But I want you to trust me. And I want to be able to trust you. Yes?
What do you want me to do?
I have absolutely no idea. It has nothing to do with me. And we never had this conversation.
Okay? I mean I am going to need a little more detail, man, because —?
You just need to go to the office. Sign out some boxes, do some shredding and meet some lovely guys?
Oh what? Is this the thing?
Why are you making this a big deal, Greg? It’s not a big deal. A chimp could do this, Greg! A little chimpanzee!
Welcome, welcome.
Happy Thanksgiving. This is …
Yes, Willa. I heard you were coming. But I didn’t believe it.
Happy Thanksgiving! I hear this is Logan’s favorite?
How kind. More. Excuse me? Gerri! Gerri? No? From Arnaud Larher? Oh, no, too kind.
Well, we can’t all bring cranberry sauce!
What would we do without you? You are so good to us. It doesn’t go unnoticed.
He brought her to Thanksgiving?
Do you think she charges overtime for holidays?
It’s not cool, man, one day that’s a story?
Oh, did they bring cranberry sauce too?
Forget it. You can’t get him anything. Last Christmas. I thought I’d had an idea, new MacArthur biog. He got seven copies.
So what the fuck is Ewan doing here?
Plan is a big reconciliation.
That would fuck your numbers. Whose idea was it?
Marcia, I think. You figure she’s on maneuvers?
Your dad’s suddenly all about changing the trust? She invites me  Gerri to Thanksgiving?
Amir, where are you?
I’ll be there in five minutes.
Hey. Good to see you, Uncle Ewan. It’s been too long.
Uh-huh. Likewise I’m sure. So, where’s my kid brother?
Dad? Resting, I guess.
I drove five hundred miles and he can’t come downstairs?
Yeah, I guess he’s still pretty sick. So. I mean, he’s up and about. But he’s … not really … quite his old self? He’s actually acting kind of … strange.
Like inviting me for Thanksgiving?
It’s good to see you. I’ve missed you, Uncs.
So, how’s it going? So sorry about your – woman, Shiv.
Joyce? She won, Grace. She’s a US senator.
No I don’t think so – because—
I’m pretty sure. I was there. I was up for seventy-two hours. It was kind of a big deal for me? I’ve been asked to be senior advisor.
Oh. Well, congratulations?
Thanks.
You did a great job because she’s quite – unlikable.
Well that’s true I never liked her.
Oh really. And why’s that?
I guess, kind of you know, kind of phoney. Kind of scary.
‘She want to take all my lovely money!’
Uh-huh. That’s, interesting. I mean too fake   too real?
Yeah. It’s weird. I guess she just comes off as a sort of a – bitch? You must hear that a lot?
Yeah, I mean, not usually from family on Thanksgiving …
This is what you’re dealing with, Shiv. This is heartland right here.
You don’t think she has a sort of, presidential quality?
Fuck no.


And who’s that?
I think – Marcia’s son?
And who’s that?
With Connor? Oh, that’s his whore.
The woman talking about theater?! Does he know?
Of course he knows. He pays her to suck his cock.
No way!
I actually introduced them at a party a few years ago. She wasn’t a call girl then. Well, you could call her. She just hadn’t figured out she could charge.
Oh, man, she’s coming over.
Okay, soldier. You ready? Just getting the deets!
Happy Thanksgiving!
Happy Thanksgiving. This is my cousin Greg. He’s very excited to meet you. Would you excuse me?
Hi.
Hi. Happy Thanksgiving.
Yes.
Sorry, did I interrupt something?
No. No! We were just … We weren’t talking. About anything. We were just … talking about the theater.
Do you like theater?
No. Not really. I mean, I haven’t seen a lot. But of the stuff I have, not really. So, here’s a question. Would you rather be trapped in a swimming pool with a shark or in a cage with a tiger?
Um, maybe in a swimming pool with a shark. You?
Yeah. Same.
Hey man! Good handshake. Firm. I can already tell I’m going to like you.
Okay. Well, I like your handshake too, I guess.
And I’ve shaken a lot of hands. A  . Handshake buddies! Okay you! Okay. These are the file numbers. This is the room number. You good?
Shame I wasn’t on a percentage?
I’m sorry?
Because I introduced you. I’d be a rich man by now! Oh. That’s right. I am anyway.
May I ‘cut in’?
What? I was ironicizing. I just think it’s better to be honest about this stuff, we’re all just raking the green, baby.
That’s enough.
Nothing I can’t handle.
Listen, Willa, here’s the thing. I hate the ‘jokes’. And I hate the atmosphere – and I’ve been thinking. And I have an idea. You’re such a great person. Such a great writer-producer. I want to help you. With your career and … really the financial aspect isn’t a concern. I can fund your work and—
How do you mean?
I mean, I’d like us to be kind of … ‘exclusive’? You’d get to stop hanging out with other – people – and you’d have more free time for theater? What do you think?
Well it’s obviously intriguing.
And if you wanted you could live with me in New Mexico?
No.
Of course. I mean—
I mean I need to be in the city for my work?
Well that works too! Look we can discuss the details. But it’s just great you’re open to this – this— this opportunity, for progression. It’s intriguing! It’s so intriguing it’s kind of making me horny, is it you?
Should we keep on waiting indefinitely for Rava and the kids before we eat?
They’re on their way but … please, go ahead. It’s hard for her, you know, her stepdad is very demanding so—
Of course, it’s just a shame they couldn’t be with us for the whole day.
How about Dad? Will he be joining us at all?
He’ll be right down.
I’m worried about him, Marcia.
I’m worried about you. When I see you, you always look so tired. We both just want you to be happy.
Well I am happy. Mission accomplished. Don’t worry about me.
Shiv’s found something she loves. What do you really want to do?
It’s clear what I want to do. And what do you want to do, Marcia?
Oh, just to look after your father. That’s all.
Uh-huh? Yeah?
Logan! Look who’s here!
Well, Ewan.
Logan.
How was the journey then?
Extremely long. You look terrible, I must say. ‘Haggard’.
Thank you, I’ve been extremely unwell.
Alright. Everyone! Food’s ready. Please!
Go ahead please, we’re eating ‘family style’.
Oh, ‘family style’, what almost like we’re a family?
So. How’s the ranch?
Well why don’t you come and see for yourself sometime?
Thank you, what a kind invitation.
Any   issues. Huh? When we were kids, my uncle used to get us to kill the squirrels. I’d throw them in the trash but Ewan used to bury them with Palm Sunday crosses for headstones.
That’s sweet.
One time, Ewan had been watching them tanning hides at a ranch. Tell them what you did.
I decided to tan a squirrel’s hide.
And how do you do that? Pray tell?
Skin it. Wash it, dry it. Then you use the oils from the brain to tan it.
Bullshit!
Every animal has a brain big enough to tan its hide.
Naturally.
You basically cook the brain into a kind of soup. Then you mash it … .
I’m glad we’re having this conversation while we’re eating.
I must write down this recipe.
I think it’s in Gwyneth’s Goop book.
Then you rub the brain soup all over the hide. Put it in the freezer. Stretch and soften it. Then you smoke it.
You smoked squirrel? Grace, didn’t you try that?
And then what did you do with it?
Used it as a blanket for his teddy bear.
Did one of the serial killers do something like that? I mean yours sounds cute.
Took him about a week all in all. But you tanned that tiny hide.
I did. Till Aunt Vee threw away the blanket and she threw away the bear. Never been able to hang on to anything, have I, Logan?
Hi, hi, sorry we’re late— Happy Thanksgiving! We’re on the turkey trail.
Hey? Where’s Iverson?
He’s outside. He’s just having a … moment, guys. Sorry. I’ll stay sitting with him.
It’s fine. I will. I thought we were in first position?
Don’t go out there. Get him in here! He needs to be told.
He just needs some time. Transitions are difficult.
Maybe we should tell him to come in? Few more boundaries?
Er – these are the boxes I need?
Okay. Pass?
And you presumably, you keep that. Obviously. The record of who got what, when?
Uh-huh.
And that record? Where does that information go?
No idea.
Cool. Great. Who cares, right? Just asking cos. In terms of sharing it with third parties? I just like to keep pretty a tight handle on my data!
Man. Your dad. Fuck  .
I know. I guess, he had it pretty rough. Different generation.
Uh-huh, go back, I’ve got this. I’m sure it’s my fault anyway.
I wasn’t saying that, Rava, fuck, I was just saying maybe Iver would like to feel where the line is sometimes?
Come on, your food will get cold.
Why are you calling me? Do not call me. Is there a problem? Don’t tell me if there’s a problem. Don’t tell me anything. Your phone shouldn’t even be on.
I signed at the depository for the document crates? And I’m in the room, Tom. Is that okay?
Well you know what to do?
But is it okay? Because it feels like a Watergate scenario. And I never studied it but I believe I am correct in saying they all got fucked.
It’s okay. Greg! Of course it’s okay. It’s a job.
So Logan, when do we get to see the famous medal collection?
Oh, god, please no. Wait. Did someone pay you to say that?
Maybe some other time?
My dad was a naval officer. I’d love to see them?
Me too. Might inspire a jewelry piece. I mean, medals are basically jewelry but for killers.
Everyone take note, this was not my suggestion.
And are they expensive?
Varies. This is a Victoria Cross.
You should collect something like this. It’s nice to have a hobby.
Uh-huh, you see me stamp collecting? I guess I could show you my rusty sheriff’s badge? Shiv’s got a big collection of pictures of those.
Yeah yeah yeah.
This is a World War I 16th Canadian Infantry medal.
Uh-huh?
Now, of course the Assyrians wore medals before the Romans but this is Roman and—
And excuse my ignorance, but did you win any of these?
Ha! Of course not, he’s never served.
Is it okay if I—?
Maybe don’t touch. This one did cost rather a lot.
Not as much as it cost the man who won it.
I collect them out of respect.
Oh I’m sure.
Look, fifty years ago you volunteered for a war because you wanted to impress the town slut and no one’s ever allowed to hear the end of it.
I thought Canadians only fought on ice!
Thirty thousand Canadians fought communism in Vietnam.
Yeah, thank you, thank you, thank you, what do you want, a medal?
Kept us free.
Viet Cong coming up your drainpipe in Ottawa were they?
Free to pump your poison. Carnival barker for all the oil wars we didn’t need.
Did you even fire a gun? Didn’t you end up cleaning grill for the catering corps?
C’mon now, please—
They should send you the bodies.
‘Bear any burden, stir any gumbo.’
I don’t have any of your channels in my house. I see them at the place I go for noodles. And I’m frankly embarrassed.
Bullshit, you don’t have them because you’re bitter.
Climate change! The blood of billions on your – hands.
Yeah yeah, you got your fucking nut, Captain Cautious.
Everything isn’t about money, Logan. Have you ever heard of ethical considerations?
Uh-huh. Ever heard of a begging letter?
One fucking letter? I got a thousand acres, you got the rest of the world.
Oh yeah, big man, big brother, wouldn’t eat a blueberry till they’d been weighed and written in the ledger? Little Miss Prim.
You can’t say who I am, you are not the arbiter of what’s true!
Yeah yeah. Heard it all before.
I was told you were ready to apologize.
For what?
You’re all liars. You’ve lied to me and you’ve humiliated me.
But apart from that have you had a nice time?
Are you trying to leave dramatically, Ewan?
You may have dragged my grandson into your filth but you won’t drag me.
I’m so sorry.
I can’t think why we don’t invite Ewan every Thanksgiving.
I mean, I don’t know what I’m doing. But if I did, it could be really serious.
You don’t know what you’re doing?
What, really?
Yeah, really.
Well yeah really I know what I’m doing, obviously. But I think if it came to court or something I could get off by saying I’m like a ‘goofy dolt’?
Yeah I think so.
Well don’t assent so readily, Mom?!
I’m just agreeing with your idea, Greg!
The thing is – even if I play the, the, hapless jerk— You know the Sarbanes–Oxley statute? ‘Obstruction of justice’? ‘Spoliation’? I could get fined up to a quarter of a million dollars. Or twenty years in jail. I don’t have a quarter of a million dollars, Mom.
Well, son, you need to figure this one out? Okay?
D’you think, Mom? D’you think I need to figure it out?? I’ve fallen down a well here and you’re shouting, ‘You’re inside a well!’ Jesus!
Hey!
I knew it was a mistake. I’m going.
Can we talk?
You can try. He lies. And he thinks he’s telling the truth. It’s infuriating.
Yep.
All I ever got was a mouth full of garbage.
He’s tough. He is tough. There’s something in there, but he’s tough.
I thought nearly dying might have changed him?
I think he has changed. I don’t think he’s himself at the moment. He’s a lot sicker than he’s letting on.
Uh-huh?
He’s erratic, he’s making bad decisions. I’m serious. If he’s not careful he’s going to destroy the company.
And you have a plan?
I’m considering. Look. I never got a chance to know you, Ewan. But I liked you. I’m going to say something now. And I’m, I’m putting my prick in a cigar-cutter here. But at the next board meeting, there’s going to be a vote of no confidence. I mean, do you have confidence, in him? So. What do you say?
My brother is an ex-Scot, ex-Canadian, ex-human being. But he’s my brother and I won’t betray him.
Okay. I get it. Let’s talk? .
Greg’s getting it done. He’s not having fun. But he’s getting it done.
Do you think it’s all going to be okay?
This is no way our worst Thanksgiving.
So apparently your lawyer is talking to my lawyer.
You mean your mom.
Yeah. She’s got all excited about bumps and tiered share option tie-ins for my sperm count et cetera and I’m just saying no no, but she noticed re infidelities there’s no—
Yeah we don’t need to do that.
Cos that’s not going to happen.
Right. And if it does. You know. We’re both grown-ups.
Yes. Meaning?
I don’t know. Nothing’s going to happen. But, things happen. We both travel.
I don’t travel that much?
Yeah, well, anyway, point is – shit happens.
Does shit happen?
No. Not to us. No. But yes shit happens. That’s why we have the expression, ‘Shit happens’. Tom. I have not cheated on you. Because I love you.
Thank you.
I believe her. Do you believe her? Of course, she does coach professional liars for a living. So you do have to factor that in.
Thanks, guys. Thanks! Just another bunch of corporate materials. Headin’ for an extra shreddin’! Happy Thanksgiving! You’re doing a great job! Really proud of you! Have a good one, guys!
Uncle Ewan – what have you got in mind? Because I have to say, I was only kicking some notions around? Nothing is set, so I hope you’re not going to make a big deal of this?
I’m only thinking— It’s for his own good, for everyone’s good.
You know it’ll kill him. Is that what you want?
Of course not. I want him to be able to relax.
Right. What a son. Lovely. — Forgot my stick. We’re going. Come on, Greg.
Oh, okay? It’s just, I only just got here and – tomorrow I’m kind of busy. I have stuff to, they need me here, basically. I’m kind of important … and pretty hungry so—
How am I meant to get home?
Uber?
I’ll call one of our guys.
This whole family is a fucking nest of vipers. They’re wrapping themselves round you and they’re going to suffocate you.
Pretty sure that’s boa constrictors, Grandpa. Zoology.
Okay. You, enough. Get in there now. See? The Biggest Turkey
What are you doing? Who put this on? Gracie.
Why are you laughing?
The big turkey just ate the family’s corn.
And you think that would happen? But how did it even get from Colorado to eat the corn? Exactly, that’s a big plot hole right there. Enjoy the movie, kids. Grace?
Assholes.
Hey that’s—
What the fuck, Grace?
It was just there. I’m sorry. It’s actually pretty good?
Yeah? Is it. Is it? Really?
Yes.
Well look. Fine. But I think we have irreconcilable differences, so. I think we need to have a talk.
What talk?
What talk? The ‘I’m sorry – insert name here – it’s just not working. I hope we can always be blah, let’s keep in blah, I’ll never forget such and such …’ That talk.
Oh right, that talk? The ‘why do we only fuck once every six months’ talk?
Yeah fuck you. You got plenty.
All good?
All done.
I don’t want to know and don’t ever tell me. But well done. Here.
Thanks, man.
Welcome to the family.
Okay, everyone. Ready for pie?
Hey listen, I have an idea. We should do what my family do at Thanksgiving …?
Fuck the turkey?
Go to other people’s dinners?
We go around and say what we’re thankful for?
Very well. Yes. Let’s do that. You go first, Tom.
I can’t go first. I need to go last because … I’d like to go last.
Okay. I’ll go first. I’m thankful to have the family all together.
I’m thankful I wasn’t born a Siamese twin.
Because?
What, you would? To be like fused to someone by the chest. Or to have two bodies and one head. C’mon. Gross.
Yeah I guess I am thankful for that. And I’m thankful for this delicious food.
Yeah me too. The food. Amazing.
I’m thankful that Uncle Logan is feeling better.
I think we’re all thankful for that. That goes without saying.
Me? I don’t know. I’m thankful I’m not in a refugee camp I guess, this is better than that.
And so say all of us!
Well. Can I say? I’m thankful for the opportunity to head up animation in Europe and I hope to turn around an underperforming division.
Well I’m thankful you told us about that, Dad?
I am thankful for, uh okay, for my two boys … And while work has often kept me from seeing them as much as I’d like, I – I have been able to provide for them and their education.
I’m thankful for Frank not oversharing.
I’m thankful to have Willa here.
And I’m thankful to be made to feel so – welcome.
And   thankful that I’m going to be marrying into one of the most – interesting and vital and— kind and loving families in the world!
Let’s hold him down and cut out his tongue.
Please?
Well since we’re talking families. I have a little announcement! Willa and I are pleased to announce I have asked her, and she has agreed that we are to … take the next steps.

No, we’re … we’re, going steady.
You’re ‘going steady’? What are you, nine?
Me? Oh I’m thankful for all the love Roman has shown to me and for never being selfish or self-centred or egocentric or neurotic or unfaithful.
Okay, a game? Shall we play a game. Let’s gather the children!
Congratulations on your ‘next steps’.
Thank you.
I’m interested to know what ‘next steps’ actually means. Is there a greeting card I can buy that says, ‘Congratulations on  ’?
Your good wishes are all that’s necessary.
Is there a ceremony? Or is it more of a financial arrangement?
Hey, listen. At least I’m only getting fucked by one member of this family, yeah?
I went to the market and bought a pony, a big fat hen and this …
I went to the market and bought a new hat, a pony, a big fat hen and this.
I went to the market and bought a crack pipe … What? What? Okay, okay, I bought a gimp suit … Fine. I bought a potato, a new hat, a pony, a big fat hen and this. Come on, Dad, what’s it going to be? A hot dog. China. Immortality. Huh? The soul of the nation?
You went to market and you bought?
I went to market and I bought. Local TV.
Okay. Local TV and …
Can he buy that?
Dad gets to buy whatever he wants. So, come on, Pop – ‘and’—
What …  ?
Clock’s ticking. Time’s running out. Local TV, and what did I say?
Um …
A potato.
Cheating! Come on, Dad!
Big … turkey?
Don’t mention that in front of Roman!
You lose. Grandpa loses! You lose, Grandpa! You lose.

6,"Are you alright? I hardly touched him, it’s the shock. Relax. Relax, boy!
He can’t relax, can he?
Get him a mirror, get him a mirror!
We’re not doing the mirror, let him cry!
Are you hurt? Did he hurt you?
Yeah?
I can’t believe it! He’s a fucking monster. They’re monsters.
I don’t think Dad meant it?
He would never physically harm another being.
But Amir. That’s hard, it must have been nice for you him being down at Wharton? Tough on you him going to Europe.
Life is hard.
Uh-huh. Still, at least you’ve got some skin in the game now, ah?
I don’t concern myself with business, Siobhan. I leave that to you clever kids.
So, what was Ewan talking about earlier, Ken?
I don’t know. Everyone’s pretty upset. Don’t take any notice.
Why was he so mad at you?
Oh I don’t know. It’s just the usual family hatred you get at Thanksgiving. You know how it is.
Listen, are you planning something?
Yeah. I’m planning on going home and taking some Advil.
I love your dad. Personally I’ll always be there for him. He’s a great man.
Yeah well, no one can argue with his record. You know he used to give us a mirror, when we were kids, to show us how ‘dumb’ we looked crying?
But my job, I work for Waystar, not Logan Roy. Are you thinking of a vote of no confidence? Because if you are. I’ve spoken with Frank. And, I’ve seen all I need to see.
Well I’ve looked into it but I’m afraid from Oswego you’re going to need to call a Canadian Uber. Do you have the app on your phone?
My telephone is at home screwed to the wall.
Thank you for today. I love you.
That’s – that’s a what a lovely thing to say.
Hey hey hey! Captain Spooner coming in to spoon!
You know what. I don’t think I can do it?
What?
Joyce’s PAC. I just don’t think she’s the one. I’m not sure I can take her all the way?
Yeah. Smart. I was never sure about her.
You were never sure? Then why the fuck didn’t you say anything?
It’s not a biggie. I don’t like any pols, Shiv.
This bed isn’t a king is it? We need to get a bigger bed. It’s so airless in here, I can hardly breathe.
You can have some of my air!
Could you move over? That’s too close.
Oh fuck, my eye.
Oh shit, Tom. Sorry. But you were right over on my side.
I went to the market and bought a potato, a new hat, a pony, a big fat hen and this.
Dude, this is impressive. I’m impressed. You hooked it up for once.
Okay here we go. Here we go.
Great show, man. Way fucking great.
You’re imperial. This is imperial right now. Imperial.
No doubt. Thanks, gentlemen. Good looks. Much obliged, gentlemen.
Do we – follow?
Be cool. Be cool, Stew.
I am cool. I’m fucking cool.
Jess – will you?
He’s your boy huh?
So, listen, can I talk to you about something?
He’s decompressing apparently. But he’s really keen to connect?
He’s ‘decompressing’? What, from his journey to the bottom of the fucking pop-rap ocean?
But the label has a room for us?
Maybe remind him he owns the firm that owns the firm that owns the label that pays him, yeah?
Um, shrimp! Served in la spew. Warmed in an airless box for six hours, and served with – is this – goo? It is. Delicious goo.
I need to ask you something, but once I’ve asked, I’ll have asked, and while it’s not a big deal, it’s delicate?
Dinner and a show. And now I have to blow you?
You give toothy head. Everyone at school said so.
So what is it? You’ve fucked the company?
I haven’t fucked the company. I have something to tell you.
Scientology?
Look, we’re friends. I can trust you, right?
No.
Sure, but on money stuff I can trust you?
No.
Good, look, I know, deep down, I can trust you. Which is why I’m going to tell you this …
Uh-huh?
I have a collection of Victorian dolls and I hump them and cry into their hair.
Uh-huh?
What? You look so serious. No you’re going to want in on this and on the right side because – we’re calling a vote of no confidence in my dad.
What the  , man!
It’s the best way forward right now.
Oh my god. Holy shit, this is terrible, you’re going to fuck the company and I’m going to lose all my fucking money!
Relax. It’s just cleanest. He’s, he’s – lost it. He’s going to Washington tomorrow. To piss away our political capital and cement us in a dying sector.
You think you can win?
Of course. It’s finished. Not even close. I’m informing you, not courting you.
Cos I’ll have to work with whoever’s left?
Right – with me. So – we good, can I count on your vote for Team Future?
Look. I can promise you I’m intellectually and morally and emotionally totally behind – whoever’s going to win.
He says he’d love you guys to join the party. Very sorry not to get you in right away. Crossed wires.
Okay! Now he’s realized! Now he knows!
Stewy, you staying? Tell him I had to go, and he’ll be shooting his next promo on a fucking flip phone.
What’s the matter?
Nothing. Fucking Wi-Fi on this phone. How much do we pay the crooks for this crap? Okay. No it’s okay I was on the wrong fucking thing—
You want to take five before we get in?
Do you want a cookie?
It’s not my blood sugar. I’m pissed I have to come to him like a fucking FedEx guy. Why can’t he come to us?
Well, I suppose, he is the president?
Fucking Californian shrunken little raisin. Seen ten of them. He’s basically an intern. And you’re okay on this, Karl? On the law?
Sure thing. Sure. Gerri walked me through it too so—
Wish she was here not you.
Well thank you. She needs to stay in the city for board-meeting prep.
It’s a joke, Karl.
It’s gone. It’s fucking gone! Call Microsoft, call Gates, we should run one of these outfits, this is all fucking bullshit!
Give him a cookie.
—and I’m guessing, if I say, cortado with almond you’re going to look like I’m some kind of jerk, right, here in 1982 or wherever we are?
I’m just concerned we don’t bump into anyone?
So. How did it go with Stewy?
It went great. He’s in, naturally.
Okay. Well. That’s – great?
So we’re all good.
Uh-huh. Shall I just run it once more, before we open our kimonos in public?
So. Givens. Logan. Soon as the vote’s proposed, he’s recused. Out of the game. Kendall, Roman, Frank three votes in favor.
Asha. Your pet. That’s good?
Rock solid. Already floated and noted.
Paul, Dewi and Datu are old guard. They’ll go Logan.
Yeah well, sure. I mean— But sure.
Uncle Ewan? He’s still a possible, right? Could you try again to stoke the resentments?
Oo! Lady Macbeth, getting her little fucking screwdriver in?
It’s not a fucking teddy bears’ picnic, Roman? It’s a massacre.
Could do, if we wanted, just, is he unpredictable?
Let’s not poke. Hasn’t voted in years. Count him out. Won’t come.
Fine. Ilona?
She’s a thousand years old. What has she got, something disgusting?
Cancer. It’s quite a common ailment. You might have heard of it? She’s not attended for three quarters – which you’d know if you had?
Alright, Captain fucking Prickle. Do you need to jerk off? Because I’m getting a lot of rage here.
Looks good?
Got to be tough on ourselves, guys?
I think if you called, explained, she could be another one for Team Kendall? And Roman.
Didn’t you go on a date with her daughter? You could rekindle the flame. Flash the wang, splooge us to victory?
Could? Could. Don’t want to spread the news too wide?
Lawrence?
Logan would sell Vaulter for parts. Lawrence would be crazy not to vote with me.
Except he hates you?
Bluster. He’s my bitch.          
Three for Logan, five against, three unknowns.
Oh c’mon, this is bullshit. We push, Lawrence is ours. Ewan could be ours. Ilona could be ours. Gerri can’t vote but she can talk for senior management. This is done, there’s being cautious and there’s being fucking time-wasters.
If you want me to do this. Got to look worst-case. Lawrence, Ewan, Ilona, all in play.
Uh-huh. I mean, just. One more makes us sure winners?
Sure. We hit Lawrence. Okay?
Great. Care to drink the evidence?
I had a call. The nuclear reactor has been sealed off. We’re in the safe zone. It’s all good.
Great. Great. Thank you. And goodbye. Goodbye forever! I have just been given the all-clear. Yes, O beast of the southern wild!
 … Three men own half of the wealth in America. You know what. That’s not a great system. That is not okay. That’s not luck, and is certainly not the almighty intervening. That’s a system we have built, or a system we have allowed to exist. While we also allow some of the children of our nation to grow up in poor housing, attending poor schools with parents working two or three jobs for wages which are falling because more and more cream is floating to the top.
I can finally breathe. Honestly I feel like this nine-hundred-pound gorilla has finally stopped fucking me.
Uh-huh? This the thing I don’t want to know about?
Uh-huh. And now it’s gone. Poof! I think I’m good. Greg. Me. The circle’s tight.
And you can trust Greg?
Greg’s a disciple. He’s Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Paul, George and fucking Ringo all rolled into one.
I don’t know. Ugh. I just I – I don’t fucking know! Do I stick with her? Is that a president?
Now I hate to be Groomzilla but can we talk venues? Because I really like Lake Como but I’m worried about fog?
I know one thing: people don’t change. Candidates don’t change. You plump and primp and re-present but if you think you’re going to change them, fundamentally? Forget it.
So shall we just go very, old-New York classy?
Uh-huh, um, on that I kind of had a shitty call with my mom? And to smooth things, I said we might go to England, for the wedding.
You what?
Yeah. Is that a biggie for you?
Excuse me? Shiv? What the fuck?
Tom. It’s just the wedding. The planners will figure it out.
‘Just the wedding’? Shiv?
Tom. I can’t do this right now. Okay? I’m thinking about work. I’m looking forward to it, I just can’t get into it all. And it might need to be in England but maybe not. Okay?
Okay. Fine. Let’s talk about it tonight. Let’s cuddle up here in our PJs and talk it all out over a Thai and a Gewürztraminer, yes?
Uh-huh? Okay. Okay. Let me think.
Okay. So I take Lawrence, you firm up the others?
It’s okay, I got him.
I know the guy, I see him at every fucking fakers party and phoney soft opening I go to. We’re two peas in a metrosexual think-pod. Hey. Are we doing this? Are we running a fucking company together, or what? Just because I like a joke doesn’t mean I’m a fucking clown, and just cos you look like a fucking statue doesn’t mean you’re cool?
Rome, it’s delicate …
Oh the delicacies? The little nuances I couldn’t possibly— Lawrence hates you.
And he likes you?
Actually, yes. People like me. I look like a matador and everyone wants to fuck me. I see him around. Trust me, this one is mine, okay?
You okay?
Why? Do you wanna fucking make out with me? Course I’m okay. I just want this nailed down.
Gerri says we have multiple indicators he wants to be sympathetic to our expansion.
D’you think, Karl? He waves this through, he gets hundreds of local TV stations most amenable to talking about what a fucking great guy he is.
He just has to be prepared to take a little political heat is all.
Four more years. We’re Procter & Gamble of news.
Nate, it’s Shiv. Thanks for meeting up at such short notice. I’m getting on the Acela now. See you at – at – the old place? Tom, hi! Listen, I’m going to DC. To see Joyce, yeah? I think I’ve got to do this thing full-on or pull the ripcord, yeah. Get some perspective. Do you mind?
Sweetheart, no fine. If you need to think about your commitment to Joyce then do it, go. Go to Washington. I get it. I do. Slide her under the X-ray machine, baby!
Hey, man.
Hey.
Everything okay, Greg?
Oh sure.
Good. Because you know you can talk to me about anything?
Oh? Thanks. Fantastic – resource.
Okay, listen. Shiv’s going to Washington. How about tonight I – take you out? No?
What? For real? I thought you were going to say, ‘take you out … and beat the shit out of you’ or ‘take you out and put a bullet in your dumb fucking head’ or something else, you know, funny.
No, Greg, I’m not some beast!
Well, I actually did finally get paid and I was thinking of maybe going to … have you ever visited the California Pizza Kitchen?
Oh dear lord, no.
It’s pretty delicious, Tom.
No it isn’t, Greg. I mean it might taste delicious to you, but it’s not.
Right. I mean they make a Cajun chicken linguine, just how I like it.
Well it’s not how you’re supposed to like it. Look, you probably have quite an undereducated palate. But come out, I’ll teach you. I’ll show you how to be rich. It’ll be fun!
It’ll be just along the hallway here, Mr Roy.
Uh-huh. I’ve been here before.
Someone will be with you shortly.
The whole fucking song and dance.
Mr Roy, I am so sorry. But the president passes on his sincere apologies, he’s currently dealing with a matter of Homeland Security. He’s sure you’ll understand, but he’s going to need to offer an alternative face for this discussion.
‘An alternative face’, what the fuck does that mean? I could drop my pants and show you an alternative face, how does that sound?
Have I been snubbed? Find out if I’ve been snubbed.
I don’t think you’ve been snubbed.
Is this a snubbing? Just fucking find out.
It really might be a Homeland Security issue?
Maybe. Or maybe it’s the new ‘can I get out of gym class, I’m on my Homeland Security Period?’ bullshit.
Why would he invite you down?
To snub. To distance! He thinks this old buffalo is getting taken down, well  .
Hey. One detail, Frank – do we need to slip something in the agenda to cover the vote?
Er, sure, it’s in. Under the ‘Matters for Discussion’: Presentation by Management focussed on Performance Issues? And, what’s the word, numbers?
Rock solid. Okay? And final nail. Roman’s having dinner with Lawrence.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
Relax, old man. Relax. Tomorrow we storm the castle. Using your dome as a battering ram. I’m sorry, Wambsgans, but do you have a black eye?
You should see the other guy!
Who, the guy who jammed his dick in your eye?
Let’s just say – I was in   with Shiv.
And what – she punched you?
No, it can just get a little hot and heavy. A little freaky-deaky.
Oh, man, that’s our sister!
So, what’s going on? Clue me in.
We’d just finished, buddy.
Yeah, and I’ve got to go eat some fucking – elk or something.
Bag him, yeah? I need him. We need him, brother.
Okay, well, later. I’m gonna show the country cousin how to live in the city on under ten thousand dollars a day!
Hey, Tom, just to say, I know you’ve been eating a lot of shit for me that I don’t even know about, and I appreciate that.
Well, hey. Gotta be done. I just keep on chowing down.
And I want you to know. I like you. You’re Team Kendall, man. Lot of stuff going down, but you’re on the team, okay? Do me a favor. Keep your ear to the ground, let me know anything you hear won’t you?
You got it, brother. You got it.
Here’s to us!
To us.
Yes. To us.
Look at you fucking guys! If you ever have room for a threesome, let me know!
We’ll put you on the waiting list.
So look, Lawrence. I need to ask something. But – are we cool? Do we have a level? We can see each other?
We can see each other, sure.
And we’re disrupters, yeah?
Uh-huh?
Right? We don’t fear change. We eat change, yeah?
Sure. I eat change.
Cool, cool. So. Can I say something? What would you say if I told you there was going to be a vote of no confidence? Tomorrow. Kick out the old man, in with the new guard. Romey and the Homey.
You and Kendall are thinking of killing your dad? That’s kind of Greek tragedy.
Hey, not cool. Did I say I’d fuck Marcia? No. Although, I definitely would. But that’s probably Phase Two. I have to say, I am very pleased they dug up this particular cache of fermenting organs. Delicious.
Hey hey hey!
Sorry I’m late.
No worries.
So. This place has changed?
Um. Yeah. I don’t know. I mean we’ve changed. Everything changes.
What is this? Shiv Roy goes soulful? It doesn’t suit you. It’s like you’re wearing a turtleneck and a stick-on mustache.
Yeah. Well. I do have feelings.
So? Congratulations on Senator Miller.
Thank you.
I mean, not exactly the fucking Southern strategy getting a bunch of Jews, blacks and media-studies professors to vote in a Democrat in New York State but still—
Fuck you, you’ve seen the numbers.
Yeah, there’s a number of ways of analyzing—
I did a fucking good job. In the teeth of a scandal. This point in the cycle? I knocked it out of the fucking park. So here’s to me. Thank you. How’s everything in the People’s Republic of Gil Eavis?
Amazing. So. Go on. What is this, Shiv?
Okay. Well I want you to think about joining us. Me and Joyce—
Okay? Why?
I need a piece of shit on the team. Like a real amoral fucking knifeman.
Well thank you.
The team I’m assembling. We’re good on strategy, but in terms of rat- fucking and oppo-research, shit-stirring, muck-raking. We need a bit of edge. I’m just being honest. We can be honest, right?
Sure.
This is long-term planning. You know? For now, it’s the PAC. But I’ll maneuver her chief of staff out, take the top job, we go White House. I’ll run things, you could take a nice role. What do you think?
I think, is it a good idea? You and me?
Why?
Well, historically speaking, we’ve found it quite hard not to fuck each other?
We’re grown-ups.
Yeah. Yeah?
It’s great to see you. At such short notice.
Shush. Finish.
Well, I’ve eaten most of them, Grandpa?
Your mother says you don’t have any money.
Well, until recently, but now actually my pay came through and I’m incredibly rich?
Well I’m sure you’ll be very happy. She told me to feed you. So: finish!
Honestly, I think my stomach might have shrunk during, during my period of poverty?
The waste in this city is repellent. Finish it.
And how come you’re in town if I may ask?
Well, you’re a grown-up, allegedly, so here’s what grown-ups do. Kendall’s going to call a vote of no confidence in his own father at a board meeting.
Right. I mean, that sounds like a huge deal? But is it just procedural?
It’s an extraordinary act of wanton selfishness in keeping with everything I’ve come to expect from this nest of rats.
Right. Right. And are you going to tell Logan?
I am keeping my snout out of the trough. And my advice to you is: paddle your own canoe. C’mon. I paid for that, eat!
 … Yes?
Kendall. I was just wondering, if you aren’t busy, if maybe it would be nice to join your father for dinner?
Did he ask to have dinner with me?
He’s home alone. I have something unmissable and it’s the first time, since – you know I leave him.
Just him and me?
Is it a bad time, have you got something planned?
Uh. No, of course. Um, I’m around.
I’ve left a little steamed fish. Thank you.
‘Ummm.’
Exactly. When I had their monkfish I thought I was going to shit, puke and cum all at once.
Sounds – delicious. Although I actually don’t have much of an appetite?
Well you better find one quick. Because this is one of the most exclusive pop-ups in the city and we’re having the full tasting menu.
Uh-huh? Why aren’t there any prices on the wine list?
Because they’re obscene.
Okay?
Gentlemen, wine?
Now, Greg? How would you handle this?
Um, er, could we get – a – a maybe a – the pinot grigio, perhaps?
So, couple of little tips for you. Ask! Only hicks pretend to know. Display your ignorance. It’s his problem not yours. Two glasses of whatever will go perfectly please. Why should we worry? If we don’t like it, it’s his fucking problem!
Okay?
Look. Here’s the thing about being rich: it’s fucking great. It’s like being a superhero only better. You can do whatever you want, the authorities can’t touch you and you get to wear a costume but it’s designed by Armani and doesn’t make you look a prick.
Here’s the thing. If I was going to come in with you I need to know – what’s your vision?
It’s me and Kendall. Romey and the Homey. We storm the castle. We’re the fucking French New Wave—
Not Kendall.  . What’s   vision?
My vision? Is like all the kids, all the black ones and the brown ones and all the white ones they all, get together and do wind power. And fuck, or something.
Uh-huh?
Look. You know what. I ended up in a bookshop the other day and I just started to laugh?
Uh-huh?
Yeah, I looked at all the books cramming up all the walls and I just thought, you know, about the olden days, all the fucking monasteries and the bibles and the sermons and the ‘did Jesus say this? Or mean that?’ and all the wars and what-have-you. All  . No one gives a fuck.
You’re saying. We’re going post-literate?
Oh, people are gonna read, but the old world it’s gone. Papers gone. ‘News’ gone. Channels gone. Big man gone. ‘Tune in to ABS at nine o’clock to get told what to think.’ No. Over. It’s all about the morsels, man, feed me the fucking tasty morsels. Keep me interested. That’s where we’re headed. Tasty morsels from groovy hubs. We need to be in the hub club.
Yeah?
Look. I’m dumb but I’m smart, okay? I’m too dumb to fix our whole company. I’ve got no attention span. This is the most interesting thing that’s happened in my whole life and I’m thinking about six other things. But I’m fucking smart enough to see what needs changing. And I’m smart enough to spot the people who can help,  . So, are you in?
Well. I’m on the side of change.
So, listen, Marcia’s asked me to have dinner with Dad?
Fuck. He knows. Does he know?
I don’t know.
He knows. Don’t go. It’s going to be horrible. He’ll chop your dick off and stuff it in your mouth.
Well it’s either tonight, or tomorrow, but he’s gonna find out, bro, so I’m going.
Did he mention me?
What did Lawrence say?
He’s in.
For real?
Yes, for real. Fuck you.
Great. Thanks. If you don’t hear from me assume we’re good.
Sure. I’ll assume that. Or that you can’t talk because your mouth is taped up and full of severed dick.
Oh Jesus, what now?
Ortolan.
What—
It’s a deep-fried songbird. You eat it whole.
Tom, are you fucking kidding me?
Be cool. This is a rare privilege. It’s kind of illegal! For the head. The exact purpose is debated. Some say it’s to mask the shame. Or heighten the pleasure.
Really, man?
My god.   good. Did you eat it yet, Greg?
Not yet, no.
Eat it, Greg. Yeah?
I mean, I guess? It’s quite crunchy? And wow. That’s a rather – unusual – flavor?
It’s that brainy, gamey hit, my friend. Thank you. Songbird bros.
Songbird bros. What is this? Are you, are you trying to seduce me, Tom?
Hahaha! Yes. I am! Hahaha. Because the things we’ve done, the things we’ve seen. We’re in this together, right?
Oh okay. Is that what this is? The  ?
No. No, man, no. Well, I mean, look, we have a bond, but also – I recognize myself in you.
You do?
Sure. I was an outsider once. A young guy from St Paul, alone in the big city. And it was hard. You have to know where to go and what wines to drink and what suits to wear and you have to wear this hard shell but really we’re little nudie turtles.
Okay, can I level with you, because if I have to eat any more songbirds I’m going to barf. My grandpa already bought me dinner.
Your grandpa’s – in New York? What for?
Well – okay. Look, here’s something, that – he – he – he he’s come down for this vote of no confidence in Logan tomorrow? Did you know about that?
Are you serious?
He’s come down especially to vote. That’s kind of a big deal, right?
Here’s my thing. You say you want me, but really, you don’t.
Ooh, it’s exciting when you know more about me than I do!
You want me for my edge? Why? Because she’s not edgy enough. I can’t fix her. I’m just a guy. You should be working for a winner like Gil.
Right. You know I am actually a considerably more successful political strategist than you?
You can only work with what you’ve got and what you’ve got is – bluurgggh.
I’ve been grooming Joyce for three years.
I’ve looked at her, from our side and she – she kind of appeals to everyone.
Exactly.
Which is a little like appealing to no one? She’s nice. She’s just a very nice person.
What a horrible thing to say.
Look, you know how you’re marrying that guy, that corn-fed basic from hockey town?
Tom’s a great guy.
Sure. ‘Great guy’? And you work with the nice black lady? What are you trying to prove?
You’re such a fucking prick.
You should be with some exciting bastard like me?
I tried playing with you, you broke.
And you should be working for some fucking winner. Like Gil.
Gil’s a strong flavor.
That’s the way we’re going. Flavor. To the max. Extra cheese, extra chilli.
And what does an amoral mercenary like you see in him?
Even Gandhi carried a gun. Look, I want to shake shit up. I think things.
Oooooh.
Plus. He’s a winner. Take a look at your banknotes, Shiv. Not a lot of black ladies on them? Don’t shoot the messenger, I’m just saying, why make it hard on yourself? What’s wrong with the average white band?
Your father’s on a call in the den. He asked if you’d wait a moment?
Tom, can this wait till tomorrow?
You’re gonna want to hear. Ewan is in town. He knows and he’s come to vote.
Who’s your source?
Can’t reveal my sources. But it’s Greg. Greg is my source. We’re having dinner. He just saw Ewan.
Fuck! Seriously? Fuck! Okay, Tom, you do not breathe a word of this.
No way, hombre. My lips are sealed.
Alright. Thanks, Tom. I appreciate it. Big time. I won’t forget this.
Not a big deal. Team Kendall. Greg. It’s happening. The troops are taking Saddam’s palace. This time tomorrow, you and me … I could be like … the third most important man in the company.
Hey, Dad? Should you be eating that?
You’re not the boss of me.
Did you want to talk? Marcia said you wanted to see me?
She’s got her own game going on.
What does that mean?
You know what it means. You’ve got your game going on. I’ve got my game.
What’s your game?
Everyone’s got a game.
So. What’s going on, what’s the action? What’s the story?
What’s going on?
You heard about my meet? You heard if it was a snub?
What? Oh, yeah. I heard. It’s tough to read. I heard real security alert? But who knows. You know what I think of the whole endeavour. I still think if you changed your mind that could be great for everybody …
I’m not discussing that. Thank you for coming though. And, so, you know, the thing with Iverson. That was an accident. You try to be a good dad.
Thank you.
I think I deserve a beer!
No need. It’s bottle service. I ordered vodka.
I mean, okay? And this is – what you do is it? You like come to the club and then you come to another bit where the club, sort of isn’t?
Uh-huh, drink up. It’s two thousand bucks a pop.
 … Why?
Financial self-harm. It hurts a little to let you know you’re alive. Come on, Greg! We’re celebrating!
Is this gold leaf?
Drink the gold, my friend. Then later, you and I will take a twenty- four-karat piss!
Does he know? I heard he might know?
I don’t think so. No. I don’t think so.
Any news?
Er, we have Lawrence.
Okay. That’ll make me sleep easier, if I can sleep, which I won’t.
I’m just going to call Sarita and check Ilona’s out of the action.
Do we need—? You not worried that could stir things—?
Just to cover all the bases. Frank. Listen, is this? Is this – objectively, horrible? Is it time to—? Should we hold off, should we see what develops and then we can put this together next quarter or—?
Ken. You’ve put this together. It’s hard enough to get five fucking people together on the same night for dinner. You think you can do all this again next time around, then go ahead, hold off. Strength. Good strength, my young friend, you’re a good kid. You are. Night, Ken.
Hi Sarita. Sorry to call so late. I was just – thinking and—
Nice to hear your voice.
Well it’s nice to hear your voice. Yeah. Yeah. I – I felt bad and I wanted to check in on your mom. I assume she can’t make it to the board meeting right, sadly?
So tell me more about Mr Potato Head?
Tom. He’s amazing. He’s great.
Okay? Great.
It is great.
Well I’m pleased.
But he is great.
You’re convincing me, Shiv, you are, it’s the constant, sort of weary repetition I think? I’ve called Gil to let him know you might be available.
We’re not going to fuck tonight, right?
You know I’m getting married too?
Really? Car model or failed actress?
Ouch! There she is. Welcome home, Shiv. She’s actually a French doctor.
I’m kidding of course. That’s nice.
I mean. We could do other stuff? Theoretically.
I’m getting married in March.
I’m getting married in May.
Well, it’s not a competition.
Sure but only one of us is getting married in lilac season and it’s not you. Look. I have to say – I feel quite— I mean, could we masturbate in separate rooms? That’s quite – modern?
Oh no, come on, Nate.
Look, or, for old times’ sake, last one, absolute last one – I could just – the old traditional – simply – stick it in?
Right, ‘Romeo, Romeo, why don’t you come up here and stick it in?’ A French doctor? She sounds too nice and interesting for you.
Oh, she’s not that nice. Deep down she’s status- and money-obsessed like you.
I think this is nice. This is like being friends right?
Okay. Gil’s interested. He’s very interested, Shiv? I think you should do this? You’re hot. You’re so hot right now.
Nate, but shall we be good people?
I’d like to – but—?
Would that be nice? To wake up tomorrow and be like, phew, maybe I’m not a piece of shit?
I did text Brigitte with a pretty high-level lie about why I wouldn’t be home tonight? Seems kind of a waste?
You could stay here? We could try?
Not to – all night? Jesus Christ, Shiv.
It would be the single greatest feat of fortitude in the history of human existence.
It’d be like Lincoln delivering the Gettysburg address, with a hard-on.
They’d build statues of us.
Hey, Shiv. You do know you’re amazing, right?
I guess.
Come meet Gil. He’s not a pipe dream, Shiv. He’s going to go all the way.
We were good. We were really good.
You’re a blond beast. You should have whatever you want.
Hey? Still all good?
Still all good. Tight, but, you know, all the variables swing our way?
Sarita?
Hello, Kendall?
Ilona?! You’re up? How are you? Did you get my gift?
Yes, so my daughter told me you don’t want me voting in today’s board meeting is that right?
No, no. That’s not it at all. That’s— Can I explain?
Well, I’m letting you know, I’ll be dialing in.
Okay, well there’s some context and – there’s some issues. I know— Look, could I come and talk it through?
I’m going to dial in.
I’ll be there in an hour. We need to talk. Thanks, Ilona!
You’re going all the way out to her? Is there time?
I can make it. Fikret, call Jess. I think I have to go. I need to see what’s in her eyes. And she needs to see what’s in mine.
Look, Ilona. He was a great man. But you know he was also a bully and a— Well he had many faults. When he was doing great work everyone was happy to ignore it. But he’s putting us in a nosedive. It’s time to look to the future.
Are you ready? Let’s go.
I’m sorry, Mr Roy, skies are closed. There’s a temporary flight restriction. Possible terror threat.
No. I need to go, pal. I’ll pay whatever fine they hit us with. Let’s go.
Can’t do it, sir. FAA would pull my license.
What do you need to take off right now? Anything. Whatever you lose financially, I’ll make up in perpetuity.
I don’t think anything would make up for us getting shot down by an F-16.
How long to get to the city? Financial District.
Morning, Colin. Good day for the race.
Uh-huh. What race, sir?
The human race!
I’m on my way. The traffic’s stopped. I need you to stall.
It’s a bad line? I can’t hear you?
Gerri? Can you, we’re going into a tunnel. Stall. Is your phone working? Can I get a motorcycle courier? Something. Can you call your office?
He’s in traffic.
Oh what? Are you fucking kidding?
He says how long can we hold it?
Boston Scientific. It’s the Cadillac of stents, my friend.
Hey, man, so how are we feeling?
Good. Nice to see the war criminal.
Fucking nice guy. Lovely guy. We good? We solid?
I heard Logan started on time even when he was airlifted in from Aspen with the shattered femur?
Where’s Kendall??
What is going on? What?
They’re evacuating five blocks each way from the Stock Exchange. Gridlock.
Morning, morning. Good turn-out. So, Frank? Will you whip us through?
Um, sure. Um, I’ve just had word, I believe Kendall will be a few minutes late. Request for a late start?
No, he can catch up. Fuck that – where is he?
Stuck in traffic. That’s all I know.
Come on, let’s go.
So, it’s twelve noon and I’d like to call this meeting of Waystar Corporation to order. Roll call. Logan Roy, present. Frank Vernon, present. Kendall Roy, absent. Roman Roy, present. Ewan Roy, absent. Ilona Hughes, absent. Datu Kassuma, present. Dewi Swann, present. Paul Chambers, present. Asha Khan, present. Lawrence Yee, present. Stewy Hosseini, present. Mr Chair, we have a quorum. We also welcome our esteemed general counsel Gerri Kellman to the meeting. So, everyone has received a copy of the agenda and the minutes from our last meeting …
What are you doing?
As you may remember, that project was having some technical issues and some of the costs were running higher than expected. I think that’s all. Do we have approval for the minutes? Okay, the minutes are approved.
Ewan? Can’t keep you away.
Well, thought maybe I’d show up for once? Watch the fun.
Great to have you.
They wouldn’t let me in downstairs without a passport. Has it started?
Kendall? Where are you? We’ve already started, man, we started. What are we doing?
Tell Jess to put me through the … Polycom. Yes?
Right. Well. Moving along to um, the next item. Three-point-one— Um—
What’s ‘Performance Issues’, Frank? This looks fucking vague, why’s it so high in the hit parade?
Um, I’m not sure if we’re hitting those? Maybe we could bump that?
What the fuck is going on?
I think Kendall wants to make a – comment. He has a – um thing. He’s going to speak on – and I think Ilona’s phoning in too?
What is this? What the fuck is this?
Hi? Kendall?
Hey everyone. I apologize. I will be there shortly. Where are we at?
We are at your item. Performance Issues.
You want to wait? Where are you?
Fuck that. We’re moving on, what is this?
Gerri, Noah, if we wanted to halt proceedings, until— What do the rules say about voting to—?
I can do this. Dad. This is big. Look. I love my father. My father is a legend.
What the fuck?
Nothing will ever detract from what he’s built and what he’s done. But he is currently unfit to run this company. Not just because of his refusal to take the time to recover from serious health issues. But because every day he refuses—
Speak up. Can’t hear!
Every day he refuses to retire, he is one day closer to destroying his own legacy.
He took on levels of debt that threatened the very existence of our firm. He’s lining up dead-weight acquisitions in a sector he has a historic regard for but which are non-growth areas. If he pursues the full breadth of his megalomaniacal vision we will end up with years of political conflict with the FCC, executive, legislative and judicial branches of government. He is making decisions for a future that he no longer understands. He’s gambling our last dollars at the track on a horse that’s ready for the glue factory and I am calling for a vote of no confidence in him as CEO and Chairman.
Bullshit. No.
I’m afraid since you’re the subject of the vote you need to recuse yourself, Logan.
Jesus Christ, it’s amateur hour at the fucking circus.
You don’t get to vote and you don’t get to comment, is the situation. Really you should leave the room.
Fine. Vote!
Would you mind?
Is he there – is he still in the room?
I’m sick. I can’t move, fuck that. Vote! Come on.
Let the minutes reflect Logan Roy was asked to recuse himself.
Let the minutes show Logan Roy shoved a boot up Frank’s ass.
Well, all in favor of the vote of no confidence in Logan Roy?
Me. My hand is raised. More in sorrow than in anger.
No shit, Judas. Frank. Nice to have you back. Asha, yeah, oh yes? I see you.
Stewy?
Okay, well look. As a major shareholder I think we have to take the view this is a company matter. And abstain.
Against!
Strongly against.
We have Ilona on the line?
Hello, Logan? Hello. Yes. After consulting with my family, I am voting in favor of the motion.
Thanks for nothing. Fuck off.
Ewan?
Go ahead! What we on? Four against two, go on, fuck it, join the rats. Let’s finish this.
I vote with Logan.
I think we should take the time to consider this properly, when all parties are here.
Datu, we’re voting now.
Logan, please can you try to stay out of—?
In which case – Logan. I stick with Logan.
Hey, Kendall – you counted, right? You alright there? Four against four? This your best shot?
Lawrence?
I don’t have a dog in this fight. I abstain.
Uh-huh?
Young cardinals vote for old popes, ah?
So currently, that’s, um, four in favor of Logan stepping down, four to remain, two abstentions.
Gerri, you want to say anything to speak, to the senior management team’s attitudes here?
Well I’m an independent observer here. Non-voting as general counsel so I’m not sure that’s appropriate?
Right. Thanks.
Very – professional.
So. Roman, where’s your hand, bro?
Roman?
Kendall? Ken, you there?
He’s off the line. C’mon, son!
Roman?
You better be smelling your fucking armpit, Romulus.
I think it’s a tough one. It’s tough, but maybe—
Roman for me.
Well. I’m not sure we—
Roman?
Against.
But he started to vote? I’m not sure he can change?
He   fucking change. Whatever. Count him, out. Deadlock! Continuity prevails. I’m Chairman, casting vote, I win, it’s fucking over! My son! You lost.
Well I think there’s some doubt … in terms of whether, we’re on—
And Kendall – Frank – Asha, Ilona. Off the board. Fired, with immediate effect!
Well I’m not sure you are able to do …?
Fuck you. I can do anything. By-law. Lucy! Jeane! Security.
Well, I think the by-law depends on majority control and you no longer have, since Stewy and—
Security!
Dad this is an in-house— You don’t have to—
I’m in the middle of turning the fucking tanker! Frank, you are fired, without exit package. Asha, goodbye. Someone send a telegram to Ilona and tell her she’s no longer required and my best to her cancer.
I think we all need to take a beat.
Meh meh meh meh meh fucking meh.
Logan, stop, is it wise to fire the board? With the share price this weak? Heading into a political fight?
Take it like a fucking man. You’re out. You’re fucked. You tried to kill me but you failed and you’re dead, okay? Now fuck off.
I need to get some things.
Cry me a river. Go on. Out! Straight out, passes canceled, we’ll send the personal belongings along. No goodbyes, thank you. What am I going to do with you?
I don’t know, Dad?
I know the way, okay? I know the fucking way.
That was the journey from hell! I spent thirty minutes in a cab not moving.
Hey!
Hey.
What happened, are you sick?
I think someone poisoned me. I’m working from home.
Did someone poison you? With booze? I got you something. I missed you.
Thank you. You were away like fourteen hours?",0.3887655596446359,0.5230102888731794,0.2557568087870481,0.31525063623892935,0.30689567007357255,0.31050033475780353,0.3076110352536268,0.3142489557327336,0.4278692046575474,0.3227717390594383,0.15320694139297825,0.09064725684980988,0.17521324331843943,0.43870314205008926,0.414705509916089,0.18677514987278052,0.26863182008718,0.21010636227826276,0.15851070639892537
7,"Yeah well, sorry for missing you. What – the fuck?
What? What’s happened.
Well more – tell me more.
Has it happened?
Call me right back. The world’s blown up. — What do you mean? Did you know?
My tummy hurts.
It’s happened?
Kendall, call me! Did you know?
Yes. What’s happened? Has it happened?
I don’t know if it’s the noodles or the edible gold. I think too much edible gold hurt my tummy?
Kendall did? Well who the fuck else knew about this?! 
I don’t know why you’d expect any different.
Not a single one of them involved me. It’s complete bullshit.
It’s like I always say, you and I are the only sane ones.
What was that? Are you on a horse?
Yes I’m on a horse.
Yes, generally, when you’re talking to me it is safest to assume I am on a horse. Shiv?
Fuck. Okay?
You knew?
I tried to call you.
Not hard enough. Fuck. He’s fired half the board.
And Kendall?
Fired. Frank. Asha. Fired. The rebels are getting shot in the town square. I’ll talk to you later, Tom.
Oh, man, they’re ‘shooting the rebels in the town square’?!
It would kind of put a big hole in Joyce? Her top strategist jumps ship for the front-runner?
Thank you, Sarah. Thank you very much, that’s why I’m thinking  carefully about it.
You fired Kendall?
My children have betrayed me.
All your children?
I’ve got no one to trust. Only Marcia.
Dad? I didn’t know.
You work for that bitch. No one gives me an ounce of credit. You all stir up this poison together.
Pop. Perspective. We all need to calm down, okay, you don’t want a huge incident here. Kendall only acted this way because you took back what you promised him?
You push me. You all think you can push. You’re midges. Buzzing on my eyes. I’ll swat you.
I have the White House. The president will join once you’re on. They’re very apologetic.
Tell them I’m on. Then put him on hold for a little while?
Leave me. No one else, thank you!
Are you okay, Dad?
Fine. Don’t get all over me.
These trust-fund YouTube shits, we had some
I’m here, okay? I understand you want me to take you through my every thought?
I … appreciate finally getting to talk through the very major moves you’re considering.
It’s exciting. We’ve become aware of some very desirable assets that are available. A block of local TV stations.
TV? Yeah I remember that. They have it at my gym.
It’s so great to have the wisdom of my son’s college drinking buddy in the room.
I love how he asks for money!
We’ll want to go cash not stock. Hence—
‘Aww I feel like we only talk when you need something.’ Fine. But, there is a pressing issue, right?
Local TV, it’s just the beginning. A very scalable sector. Regulation’s in tatters, and as people shit their pants over online, I can buy everything up and still play the little guy.
I get that. I think the bigger issue is – that everyone fucking hates you?
It’s cloudy, it’s sunny.
I mean you want to push through a massive politically sensitive buy- up and I read   over my morning cappuccino? By the way I’d love a cappuccino. New York Magazin
Maybe we’ll buy that too.
Your son’s launched a lawsuit against you? You fired half the board. People say your COO’s a fucking joke.
Hey!
. People say he’s a coked-up dauphin who doesn’t know shit from shinola and you’re still not talking to each other? Now  could care less. I don’t care which way the wind blows as long as I get blown, but even the advance whispers on local TV have people so mad they’re throwing piss at you on the street?
We don’t know it was piss.
Great contribution, Zuck. But you’re not sitting downwind. You want to have a buying spree, great, we can talk. But can you figure out the visuals? This is a family business. The family’s fucked. It hurts the stock. It makes the place stink up. It draws heat. Can’t you fix it? You know this is actually a good photo of you. You’re not covered in piss?
Umm! Good. VG. VG, Tara! Food is the only thing makes me regret heading for the singularity! Uh-huh?
But nevertheless. Nevertheless, I personally can’t wait to shed this human body and just – upload. What will you do without a body, Con?
Freakin’ relax, man! Chess and Johann Sebastian. Hello, eternity! Apologies, folks, I know I ask you not to, but this is family. Marcia?
Hello. Connor? I have a question for you.
Yes! Yes! Of course. I’m a resource, Marcia. Use me! Fantastic. I think it’s superb. Love to you. Love to Dad. Okay, folks. It’s happening! I am hosting a family get-together! Oh. That’s great. Great.
Oh sure I know, but I’m confident, very confident they’ll come this time! Willa. I need you to come to New Mexico for the weekend! I’m playing my joker, honey!
Do you have a joker? I’m not sure it’s convenient?
I’ll make it up to you. Let’s crunch it over email.
Okay well. I guess we can chat.
Oh that’s great! Willa too! We’re going to be a full house!
The Revolutionary War, the Civil War, the Second World War, when this nation has been tested, freedom has always won out. And that’s what I believe we face right now. Nothing less than a war against inequality. A war against human beings being devalued by technological change. A war we must fight to stop unimaginably vast power and riches, ending up in the hands of an impossibly small number of men. I’m not afraid of this fight, I know you’re not either. This fight starts here.
All the class-war shit? Don’t you find it a little jejune?
Jejune?
It means—
I know what it means I just thought only assholes said it.
Okay so is this you pulling my hair? Cos why are you even bringing me in? I’m not a good fit.
Shishi, I genuinely believe he’s going to be President of the United States. And you know me, I barely believe in anything. Are you finished with Joyce now?
That’s as far as she’ll go.
He’s all over blowing the base till Tuesday. Colorado then Texas and New Mexico.
New Mexico? And   wouldn’t be an issue?
What?
The – atmosphere?
I don’t feel an atmosphere …? I think as long as we have clarity.
Right?
And to be clear. At absolutely any place at any time, with absolutely no consequence, I will fuck you and want desperately to fuck you and that is just a permanent state of affairs.
I thought you were marrying a French doctor?
Oh, come on, you’re marrying a – French doctor, everyone’s marrying French doctors – I just want you to know, that is my position. So, you have all the power, and you can do what you want with it.
When did we start having to do this shit, Gerri? If I wanted good PR I’d stand on a red carpet in a fucking see-through dress.
The journalist is Leah Lorenzetti, you’ll have seen her on things, on our things.
And she gets it?
She absolutely gets it. The piece will be: ‘After the turmoil, the coming together’. A family. A dynasty. An American story. It’ll be a very compelling package, photographs—
Whatever. Just as long as I don’t have to read it. And this shit. Who is this guy? Alon? Is he going to bust my chops?
Very highly regarded corporate therapist. Harvard Business School, former CFO at a Fortune 500. He just worked with the Sultan of Brunei and the Bolkiah family.
‘Corporate therapist’. What does he do? Ask Microsoft how it’s feeling? Fucking ridiculous.
He’s more corporate than therapist.
How long do I have to sit there?
It’s very common now, a few hours.
Can we just   I did it?
Does it hurt that much, because, it’s best not to lie, you know? In case?
In case there’s a God?
It’s just cleaner.
Do they all have to be there? Does the traitor come too? Can we Photoshop the prick in?
Well, that’s obviously your choice.
But I think the message is: A family reunited in the desert. To reflect and regroup. Family unity is kind of what you’re going for.
Uh-huh.
And frankly, if you got Kendall to drop the lawsuit, everything becomes much cleaner for us acquisition-wise?
Okay, well. I’m not groveling. Get Romulus in here. And let’s do the email.
Shiv, it’s Con, I just gotta see, did you get this email about therapy? Cos this is like, wow. I just need to check that it’s not one of those spam things or something.
My only thought is, I like Gil. People like Gil. He’s great. I just have this sneaking feeling if he won an election he might quite like to line up me and everyone I know, and shoot us?
Holy fuck. No way!
What? What is it?
Have you seen this?! I can’t believe it. Dad wants to do therapy?!
I thought you weren’t talking to me?
I’m not. But what the fuck?
Oh very much the fuck. Very much the fuck indeed. The big man’s breaking down and everyone’s invited!
Not Kendall?
Everybody.
Bullshit. What’s he doing? Do you think he’s going to kill us one by one like in an Agatha Christie novel?
I’ve got to go. See you in Cuckooville.
Please, Mr Roy?
I need to talk to Kendall.
He’s not available.
He’s not available? What’s he doing? Playing with his fucking Legos? He’s nothing but available.
He – he isn’t here right now.
Well I know he is, so – c’mon, okay?
He’s not been here for weeks. I’m sorry goodbye.
Will you take a message?
I— No thank you.
Tell him to reply to the email. He has to come, okay. Tell him Dad wants him to— Hey. No. No I don’t think he’s going to play ball. No.
No?
No.
Okay. Well. Plan B. Operation Black Sheep. The Histories
Hey, Rava?
Hey. You okay?
I’m fine. What time are we doing the pick-up?
Good. Just checking in.
Uh-huh? What?
Do you ever look at Sophie’s Instagram?
Did we say yes to Instagram?
I was monitoring and some older kid linked to that shitty article about you.
What, I haven’t been looking at anything, deliberately, Rava—
Okay. You should read it.
What is it, what?
Let me – ‘Kendall Roy ran the streets of New York, sweaty and incoherent, ranting about a coup against his father, but couldn’t find his way to the boardroom to start said coup. Is he back on drugs? We couldn’t possibly say. But some people are saying that.’
Rava. That’s not true.
Yeah. It’s just that’s what you used to say when it was true?
Jesus. I’m not using, Rava, I don’t touch anything, you know that, Jesus Christ!
I know, look, unrelated, this weekend, Iverson’s got his tests, and if we break his routine it’s gonna affect things, you know?
Okay. ‘Unrelated’.
I’m just asking. I’m happy to have them.
No! Fuck.
Don’t get angry.
I’m not fucking angry! I bet it’s Dad! He’s a bully and he can’t take someone standing up to him – I’m not on drugs, I’m not on drugs, I’m not taking fucking drugs.
Yeah it’s the paranoid rant that is so convincing.
Rava …  ?
I believe you. I just don’t want to break his routine. Let’s reschedule?
I think it’s actually brave to go.
Thank you. I’m a hero. Can you imagine: Connor? Dad? Roman?  It’ll be like tossing a bag of Uzis into the soft-play area.
And, I know he spoke abominably to you. So just for context, would it be appropriate this weekend, in a bridge-building way, for me to be speaking to Logan or no?
Just do what you feel is right, Tom.
Got it, sure. Because I want to have your back. But there’s also my back. We’re a beast with two backs.
I get it. You’re your own guy. It’s fine. I won’t judge.
No, of course, I know that.
Ooh, and it’s possible I will be breaking out to make a meeting with Gil? He might have a window.
Oh. Great. Great that he can get a, a bit of time away from the masses.
Fuck? Google alert on Ken …
Is he okay? He’s not dead?
No!
No. Great. No. It’s only because, he’s one of those people where I would be like, no! But also, yeah?
This is—
He hasn’t fallen off the wagon has he?
Yeah. Either that or he’s been pushed under the bus.
‘We just hope he is not back in a self-destructive cycle,’ one friend of the family said. ‘We are here for him.’
You shouldn’t feel bad. We tried. You still have Roman.
Uh-huh.
What does Connor do out there in New Mexico?
I don’t know. Tries to breed fuckable buffalo.
Dad! Marcia! Welcome to Austerlitz!
Thank you. Thank you. It exists!
Was this the name, when you bought it?
Oh, it was racially insensitive. So, he picked the new one. It’s a battle.
So, son, we need somewhere for them to set up? Just a few folk to help us with photos and such, chroniclers of everything.
Oh? Right? Okay.
Good place. Plenty of room.
I think he should have business cards printed for the ranch.
Really? And what would they say?
They’d say, ‘Connor Roy. Libertarian Environmentalist Cowboy Philosopher’.
They’re going to be big cards.
Thoreau of the West. I mean the spot is not strategically the best but good place to be in an apocalypse! I’m pretty much invulnerable in terms of biohazard, famine and civil unrest. The only thing I need to ship in – is love!
You’re doing great, son.
So we’re doing photographs tomorrow as well now? Because this would be good? Highly photogenic.
Nothing fancy, words and pictures. Family shots. Whilst we’re all alive. Good?
God, now I’m thinking about it, I own a large number of beautiful spots. All around actually. There’s some real humdingers. And everyone else is okay? Shiv? She happy to pose with her bros? Do you want to take a look at the buffalo?
Yes. Okay. I’ve seen the buffalo. Can we go back? I have calls.
Well hello to the metropolitan elite! Welcome to the real America!
Here he is, man of the people … who work on his ranch!
Haha!
Wow!
We’ll be in there tomorrow, that chapel dates all the way back to 1878.
The chapel, okay well at least Roman might spontaneously combust.
Yee-haw. I have never ridden a horse. Can you believe it?
Yes.
We’ll introduce Alon at a little drinks party, yes?
Randall owns the next ranch over. I said he could pop in, just wanted to say hi. He’s very big in pesticide.
Uh-huh. I don’t need any. You wait! You just wait.
No. I’m always ribbing him. You know three in every hundred bunches of grapes has above the legal level of pesticide? So you wash it!
Can’t wash your colon, Mr Poison! Why I oughtta—!
Put ’em up.
Logan will talk to Shiv so long as she says sorry?
Well, I think Shiv’s position would be that she has nothing to say sorry for? I think obviously— She’s sad about the way things happened? We could offer that?
Okay, the entertainment’s arrived! Wow, this is like the first stage of an orgy. Like kind of exciting but also super-awkward.
Okay. I did it. I blanked your dad.
Hey, Tom.
Can I—?
Whatever, hey, I’m not in charge of you. Go get us some drinks!
So where’s the actual head-doctor guy?
How would I know?
I just hope he can cure your serious case of being a bitch.
Yeah fuck you.
Fuck you.
You know Dad’s gonna try to ‘win’ at therapy.
It’s ironic. Cos if anyone needs therapy it’s him.
My guy says if he’d had therapy I wouldn’t need it.
My guy’s surprised I made it through at all.
I’m not sure you actually did make it through?
I’m surprisingly well adjusted. You’re the looney tune. You’re just the best at hiding it.
Okay, Randall, I hate to kick you out, buddy, I have had word. ‘Elvis’ is in the building.
Yeah, so, I think I’m going to reveal to him you sexually abused me.
Excuse me?
Yeah. You just would not stop.
You’re one sick puppy!
You’re the one who tried to fuck me.
Hey c’mon, stop saying that! Why would you say that? You don’t think that, do you?
No. But – competitive advantage. Could come in handy some day!
Roman’s threatening to tell everyone I touched him as a child.
Oh? Right. Did you?
No! Of course not! Tom!
Family. Now then. We are all gathered here in this beautiful home— Because there are things to address and I believe we should … address them. I think I mentioned all around that we will also have a small celebration of our being together with some photographs tomorrow, nothing fancy. As you age you begin to appreciate, capturing memories and pinning them … down. So. Allow me now to introduce Alon Parfit. Hi to everyone. I look forward to sitting down with you all tomorrow. It takes a lot of courage and that’s not lost on me. I’m very touched.
Me too!
Thanks. This family is broken. And that has consequences. A missed phone call today – a – a – bunch of kids lose their job in China. Butterfly wings. But bigger? Huge wings. Like a pterodactyl. Or the Smithsonian. So let’s fix our wings!
This is barely comprehensible.
What photographs? Did you know this?
Hi Alon, just FYI. I play it dumb but my SAT scores were off the chart. For context. I don’t need too much context. I get things pretty fast.
Oh okay. Well I guess that’s me told … ooh I feel so exposed. Please don’t brain-fuck me, Daddy.
Right. This has been fantastic. But I’m going to bed! I’ll head on up too—
Great you’re here. Fifty years late but hey better late than never! One thing. Ask about summer vacations! I’m not saying that’s where the emotional treasure chest is buried, but you know! ‘Get digging, my hearties!’ Yeah. I’ve been seeing someone for decades, so you know, I’m pretty unpacked. A lot of baggage to unpack was there?
Ha yeah no I’m boring really. She’s bored to death just listening to me each week. Everything’s terrifying isn’t it. Anyway, night. I think you’re probably the most interesting person in that room. Night. Can I take a credit card too? Any plans while you’re here?
Maybe. Patricide. Fratricide. Oh! Okay. Well that sounds expensive.
No way, now?
Uh-huh. No shit. I’m in a hotel in Santa Fe.
I can’t now, Nate. The whole reason I came out here is to do this, family thing. Can we schedule tomorrow?
He’s pretty fucking busy.
I just can’t right now.
The pressure on the faucet is moderately intense so go easy.
Shit.
Hey! It’ll be okay. You want me to come with you, into the emotional swamp? Cos soon I’m gonna be part of this whole genetic carnival. For better or worse. Haha! Okay, shall we?
Therapy! Therapy! This way for the therapy! This is fantastic! Well we haven’t actually—
If this goes right, maybe we should get you in on a nice long-term corporate consultancy? Roll up roll up for the festival of grievances!
It’s like waving your kids off to school.
They better not gang up on him. He’s still frail. Ahem. Okay. Welcome. I like to start off with what I think of as a little prayer? ‘They fuck you up, your mum and dad. They may not mean to, but they do. They fill you with the faults they had And add some extra, just for you.’ I find that poem – well it can be an interesting place to start? But I wonder if any of you feel you know how you want to start?
You’re the expert, man. Well I guess I’d say   the world experts, in you? Would anyone like to talk about what’s brought us here today?
C’mon is no one gonna have a pop at the champ?
Can I just say, I never touched Roman inappropriately. If he says I did, I didn’t.
Good to have that clear.
He was going to make a horrible joke? So I’m pre-empting. Okay, look, one good place to start is—
I can start if you want? Please?
Everything I’ve done in my life is for my children. And I know I’ve made mistakes but I have always tried to do my best by them because they are everything to me. And I love them. Okay? Great.
Thank you.
Well that’s nice. That is nice.
It is nice.
Sure. No. Agreed. And so? What do you feel in terms of that? Anyone?
I hear it. I hear it.
Uh-huh. Big words. Good words.
I’m just processing. But yeah. You’ve got a lot of power in this room, Logan, do you realize that?
How do you mean?
He’s got a lot of power everywhere. Logan, how do you feel about the idea that—?
Look. Everything I’ve done is for my children. And I know I’ve made mistakes but …
Dad, you can’t just do one sentence.
That’s what I feel, Siobhan, I can make shit up if you want? Shiv?
Look where I’m at is I’m having a hard time diving in because – I guess honestly, I wonder why did he bring us here? I mean was it for this photo opportunity?
No. No absolutely not. I wouldn’t bring you out here for a photo and an interview.
Excuse me, there’s an interview now?
I told you a photo and an interview.
No you didn’t. What? So this is a publicity event essentially?
It’s optional! It won’t be questions. Apparently it’s ‘rural wear’. I don’t know.
This is not okay. I have a publicist for this stuff. Con, did you know?
I think the photo’s nice.
Rome?
I don’t mind. Logan – do you think your children might, sometimes, be a little, scared of you?
Ha! Fuck off. After what they’ve done to me? Fuck  !
Well this is nice.
Shall I be mother? All girls together!
The First Wives Club! The current wives club …
Do you think they’re talking about us?
They will all be talking about themselves, except Logan.
This is a lovely place, Willa. Are you here often?
Not that often. I worry he won’t let me leave! Hahah. No I’m kidding. It’s incredibly quiet. Which is great. When you lie in bed, you know, you are seriously in the – calm?
And tell me do you think you’ll always do what you do?
What? The theater?
Yes and what you do – for money?
Uh-huh. Well, I like my life and. I go with the flow, so. Yeah I think I’ll just – slide over more into producing or writing or directing?
I knew a woman in Paris who did what you do. She was very intelligent.
Thank you.
And do you want children?
Um, I don’t know. Maybe one day?
Don’t wait too long. That is all I will say.
That old biological clock starts a-ticking! You can always freeze?
Uh-huh. That is a way of putting off life.
I’d like Shiv to freeze. Embryos not eggs. Little bit of me in the bank! Have you thought of that?
Um – so much advice! Maybe I’ll need therapy after this!
My friend, in Paris who was your way, she was actually murdered. But it was not to do with her being a prostitute, it was to do with a restaurant that went pouf. So?
Oh? Okay! If they’re scared of you, they’re scared of you. That’s the information you need to accept.
Fine. I don’t believe it is all. Look can we go forward with the shared agreement to put our phones away while we focus on what’s happening in the room.
I am trying to buy a number of television stations. Could you do it … later?
Fine. Tell me what more you want here and I’ll dance the dance. I guess what I want you to do is tell me how are you feeling?
I’m feeling I need to check my emails.
That’s not a feeling, Dad.
Maybe don’t deny Dad’s feelings, Shiv.
I turned down something huge to be here and now you’re just going to tank it?
I’m doing therapy!
I don’t think you are?
I am.
Well, no you’re not, Dad.
Look. What I think we should actually have a conversation about is the fact that Kendall’s not here. And that’s because there are reports all over that Kendall’s taking drugs. And I for one don’t know where those have come from.
You don’t have to worry about that.
What does that mean?
That’s not something we’re dealing with today. It’s beyond the remit.
I don’t think there really is a remit?
I had nothing to do with those stories. Shiv, do you believe your father?
Well. Go on?
Honestly no. I think this is all fake. Roman?
I don’t know.
I don’t know. No.
I mean he might not have meant to but – no.
You think your generation invented talking?! There used to be nothing but analysts and hippies running screaming on LSD about wanting to fuck their mothers. Well let me tell you I did fuck your mothers. And sometimes I’m sorry. I’m sorry I’m sorry. Alright? I’m finished. I’ll apologize as much as you fucking want, but I can’t get into everything. That’s it. Logan, if I’m ever asked if you participated fully in this family therapy I can’t yet, in good conscience, say you have.
Fine. I apologize. Maybe I’m hungry. I’ve got nothing to hide. Let’s do it, c’mon. We can do it. How about we take a break and begin again, clean slate, in the afternoon?
Hey have you got any non-alcoholic beer? Na-ah, sorry.
Fine, sparkling water please. Mineral water. Uh-huh. Tourist? Kendall – Roy. Visiting family? Connor Roy? Is he your dad?
No. What? I probably think the same. No just there’s stories. He came in here one time, had a dog with cancer he wouldn’t let the vet kill. But he couldn’t watch it die either. Dragged it round the whole bar trying to get someone to take it. Saying give her a good life. I’ll pay you, I just can’t watch. Anyway, Skunkhead Tanner, he took three grand then shot her in the parking lot.
Jesus. What? What? None of your business, talking about Skunkhead. Don’t you talk shit about me, Janelle!
Hey, also, can I get a Smirnoff, just two ice? I heard you killed my brother’s dog?
So?? C’mon. What did everyone say! Nothing too horrible? Or upsetting? Or just disgusting?
Listen, I’m going to Santa Fe to meet Gil.
Oh. So it’s all, resolved?
Yes, we solved everything. Done. Totally sane. I won’t be more than a few hours, will you be okay?
Sure. But listen. You’re okay right? Sometimes I don’t know.
Big question. Yes. Yeah. —
Can I take a car?
What’s that?
What are you doing?
The Tesla. I have a meeting in town. I’m not taking this seriously when no one else is.
But we’re getting somewhere, Shiv, I can feel it, he’s breaking down.
You’re sweet and I love you, but you’re dreaming.
You can’t go! Can she? Shiv can make decisions as an adult. But you know, I was just saying maybe we should take a break though, get out of our heads, into the good body. Everyone, get your dad out there—
Dad can’t swim.
Doesn’t even trust water.
If it helps to make up numbers I’d be pleased to … get involved.
Let’s swim!
Hey, so, um, you know, about, the family photo – later.
Uh-huh?
There was an idea maybe you should sit it out?
Yeah.
Cos it’s just family et cetera.
Uh-huh.
Sorry.
It’s okay. I’ll probably end up getting murdered anyway.
No one’s murdering you. Not statistically anyway. Look. You know – I appreciate you.
I appreciate you too.
And I think you’re better than any of them. I just wondered. Wouldn’t you – couldn’t you. I don’t know how to say this except to say: love is a strange and peculiar affliction. It’s like a – a cold, who knows when you’re going to catch it? It’s a virus. A mutating virus. Could you just stay here for a while and maybe you’ll catch it?
Con?
I know, but I’d still support you but you could take my money in the way that a wife does, not a – how you do now?
Are you serious?
That came out wrong. What I mean is, you’d have an allowance. And you can write and travel to New York and we can make a life in the theater. I could be your producer?
Gosh that’s a lot.
We have so many great ideas.
No. Sure. We do.
Let’s do family but different.
We could try.
Exactly, why not! Yeah?
Yeah.
Hey! I love you!
And I – I … love … you.
Exactly! See? That wasn’t so hard, was it?!
Okay. Lot of wolf stuff. I like wolves.
Okay. He really likes wolves.
Yes. Okay. My mom says I was a wolf child. That’s cos she never bothered to take care of you! That’s just salesmanship of her straight-up neglect. Whoooo!
You get wolves here? Nope.
I never did meth. This is like an experiment. My family own that. That screen’s only sixty-four inches. You probably have one of those – a projector, like, what are those ones, Mac?
There’s a thing now that Type A’s actually – can’t get addicted, because we are addicted. You know if it wasn’t for wolves we couldn’t speak. What the fuck about that? It was only from having to tell dogs what to do, that we ever actually got the need to like talk out loud, to command them— This is a real person, don’t start attacking his brain.
I’m not a real person. I saw it on  .
How much more you got. We need to get more. And some weed. And some Xanax some Oxy and some cigarettes. You like it?
Experiment successful. I am interested in becoming a methhead. That’s cats anyway— What is?
Who only make sounds for us. They don’t meow at each other. You want me to text our guy?
Sure. I got money. You got to work later?
Really dive deep. Don’t be scared of what you’re going to find down there!
You have to jump! I will.
Jump jump jump! You pussy!
Jump jump jump!
I feel I should apologize. For blanking you earlier. Clear the air.
For what?
Ignoring you.
What’s he talking about?
I’m sure it wasn’t clear but I try to hold myself to a higher standard— . when it comes to inter-family turmoil and etiquette and—
We have the journalist holding in Santa Fe, what do you want to do? Hi, Tom.
The guy, his teeth— It’s bad, I dunno, maybe, someone—
What was that? There’s been an accident in the pool. We might need emergency services.
We don’t know if he got a head injury or— Just my mouth.
He just dived. He hit the bottom—
Did you hit your head?
He hit the teeth.
Well the teeth are in the head, Connor, they’re kind of a central feature.
It’s signed, Alon, it’s clearly signed, what were you thinking?!
Should I call an ambulance?
I didn’t think he’d jump head-first. Hey Karolina.
Hey Roman. He mustn’t go to sleep. I don’t want to go to sleep.
Let’s have a look. The bleeding always makes it look worse than it actually … not
Jesus fucking Christ, man. What?!
We should get him to a hospital. Oh god oh no! What is it?
Yeah, you’re okay, buddy. Fuck!
Send your guy. Send Colin. We should stay. Can we go please?
I really feel I need to help him. And I want to make sure he’s not litigious.
Great, fucking great. I was about to take business advice from a clown who jumps in the shallow end. And now everyone’s fucking off!
Roman’s here, Logan. Roman’s still here. For photo, for everything?
Sure. I give good cheekbone.
Don’t worry, he’s super-nice.
Nate, Ronnie Reagan taught me how to gallop. I’m not going to turn green and do a shit when I meet Gil Eavis. This is just a fuckload of press?
They’re local, they don’t know who you are.
So naive.
Such a narcissist. Okay, so, don’t fuck this up.
Yeah, okay you’re talking! That’s nice. That’s stately. That’s great.
What?
We look good, Dad. We should talk.
Look I want you to call Japan, we, have the office. I’m tickling Sandy on local. I want you to get into the government issues of it all with the launch deal.
Right, sure. And you actually want me to do that? Or is this just words we’re spewing for the camera?
You’re COO aren’t you?
Yeah. No sure. I got it. I’m on it. I know, I was checking.
Siobhan Roy! The acceptable face of the Worst Family in America!
Gil Eavis. Stalin in a sweater.
Okay, well, happy … meeting!
So. How are you?
Really? Um. Well, my family’s fucked. I’m hardly talking to my dad and my brother’s suing my dad.
I’m sorry. If family isn’t right, nothing feels right.
And, how are you? Are you gonna go for it?
I’m feeling really good. I suffered some depression last year – after everything – but I’m good.
And – what – are you thinking I can help handle the message on that?
No. That’s just – the truth. Look. I’m not going to make you do a dance. I’m finalizing and Nate and me want you on the team. What do you think?
I think you’re too radical.
You know the good politician, he figures out what people need and sells it back to them as what they want.
So this is a job offer?
Well. Yes, but, there’s an issue.
My name?
One section of my base will be outraged at my even meeting you.
Well that section has nowhere else to go. So fuck ’em.
You know cynics are always frustrated idealists. If I’m going to win big, like I want to, to remake this country, for the better—
Ooo. Lah-di-dah!
I need to spike your dad’s guns. The papers, the news channels. that
I can’t help with that.
No. Oh no. No! Of course. But I’m gonna go for his throat. Legally, legislatively. Hearing, referrals. I thought I should tell you? It’ll be ugly.
And how do you know I won’t betray you?
I guess, I – trust you. And I think – you trust me, right? That’s all we can ever do.
I can work with Nate. I can’t work for Nate. It’s fine. It’s just a preposition thing.
We could figure that. The bigger question is do you want this enough to go to war with your family?
Can I think about it?
He’s good.
So?
I don’t know. Okay.
Okay? Listen. It’s shitty but my AirBnB has a hot tub?
Turn it off.
Not gonna go to the hotel?
Let’s just … be here, a minute. So I can think. He so rich, he so rich that he gives Oprah a car! He so rich, he so rich he need a golf cart to pass the salt. He so rich, he so rich his goldfish wear furs. Okay, he so rich, he so rich that when he cums, it’s like Perrier water and all the sperms have little top hats. You know, I don’t even care. You might be rich. But we have this. And this is real. So, who’s better off? You are. Fuck it. I do care.
Hey. Listen, Roman. I know why Dad hates us and we need to talk.
What? Where are you?
New Mexico.
What??
I realize now.
Are you high?
No. I’m at some guy’s house and we’ve been taking drugs but I’m very clear.
Ken, will you send me a pin, just so I know you’re okay?
I’ve got a lot of important information in play.
Just send me a fucking pin, okay? Do it now, are you doing it? I’m coming to get you, bro.
You’re doing the call?
I’m going to get Kendall. He’s … here. And – he’s not – great?
Okay. Okay. Go.
I’ll make the call!
Hey, man? Man? Who the fuck is that?
It’s okay. It’s my brother.
I’ve come to rescue you, man. Wow. Hi. I like what you’ve done with the wolves. I thought your brother was the rich guy with the – face?
Come on, man, let’s get you out of here.
Hey look, I probably shouldn’t even be talking to you, legally, given the ongoing situation apropos of my legal action against you as a board member for your failure to fulfill your fiduciary duty and breach of my employment contract. But – I’ve had a major realization.
Is that crank?
We’ve had all kinds of fun, thanks, Mom.
That will make you crash like fucking – Mohamed Atta, into – Princess Di. Not if you stay high …
Tanner makes good points.
Come on, let’s go.
How’s the therapy?
It was all bullshit. He didn’t even do it.
Gentlemen, this has been divine.
We should all meet up and do this again, I’ll make sure he stays in touch. Hey, Kendall, tell Bill Gates my computer’s fucked from all the fucking updates, man!
You okay?
think so.
Should I call a doctor. Or Rava? Do you want me to hit a kid so we can steal his kidneys? Listen. I’m sorry, but I gotta do this call about the launch thing in Japan, as we go – if that’s—
You do your call, brother.
Oh … Hey?
Hey!
You’re late.
Yeah. So what happened with the whole – fake therapy? Any pretend breakthroughs? Any good performances?
Nothing. Our therapist died. Metaphorically speaking. It felt like you all killed him, to me, is how it felt.
He knocked his teeth out in the pool.
And where have you been?
I was meeting about a prospective job.
Uh-huh, that’s right.
With your father’s enemy?
Okay, I’m going to bed.
I keep an eye on things, Shiv. I keep an eye.
What is that supposed to mean? I had a meeting! You do what the hell like on everything, forever.
Maybe we should chat this over in the morning?
And he has to hear it from his so-called friends. On the telephone. Dripping poison in his ear.
It is her job?
Hey, hey hey! What we fighting about, muthafuckers??
Jesus, Kendall.
Hi brother?!
What’s wrong with him?
Oh, where do we start?
Roman?
I’m off my nut, folks. Off my fucking head. Like all the papers said. Your dreams have come true, congratulations! —
Listen, just so you know, I think the launch thing is good. I talked to the guys—
Shut up, Rome! The king is angry. The king is displeased and everyone needs to pretend he’s wearing clothes.
You’d do that to me? Eavis? The one Senate member who wants to fuck me ragged? On the same side as those animals who hit me with a face full of piss!
He doesn’t even fucking notice, Rome. Give him a high-five, Dad. Come on. He’s waiting.
It’s my work, if anyone, Jesus you should—
That’s not work. This is sabotage. Rebellion.
Oh, of course, it’s about you? What if I actually believe in his points about the purchases, or just his whole philosophy …  ?
‘Philosophy’. His philosophy is to take the bread from my mouth. This is a deliberate attempt to undermine my whole business strategy.
You don’t have a business strategy, Dad! Your whole business model is based on seducing presidents. You’re a really high-class hooker. No offense.
Hey!
It’s fine. My aunt’s an addict. But I think I’m gonna—
But you know, I have to say, I do feel a little used here today, Dad.
Oh you too!
Just where we are and what’s happened, and then even tonight you just, went off and worked—
I took a few calls, Jesus, you can’t wait?
Can I wait for you to finish a couple of calls? Oh I think so. I think so, Dad, I’ve had a bit of practice, quite a bit.
Connor, your father’s been busy dealing with these two – traitors.
Disagreeing with Dad is not treason!
Mmmm. But, trying to make his biggest enemy president   kind of a fuck-you.
I liked those stories you planted about me, Dad. That was fucking nice.
You forced my hand. You’re lucky that was it. It’s part of the game.
C’mon, everybody, it’s a rootin’ tootin’ super-fun fuckin’ game for all the family!
Fine. I’ll shut it all down, the network, cable news. No acquisitions. No company. No way to distance yourself, would you like that? You run to politics to make out you’re your own man, fine, but that’s not principle. You’re scared to compete. You’re marrying a man fathoms beneath you because you don’t want to risk being betrayed. You’re a coward.
You are beyond, you are …
You’re worse than the other two!
The other ‘two’?
You know, I’m lucky. I’m a lucky person. I lucked out. I realized that. You’re so fucking jealous aren’t you? You’re so fucking jealous of what you’ve given your own kids. And you can’t … You can’t work it out.
If I’d spoken to my uncle like that, he would—
What? What would evil Uncle Noah do?
Get him out.
Cos that’s some big advance calling your daughter a coward till she cries.
Fucking – nobody. You’re a nobody.
I’m sorry.
Honey. You don’t need to apologize. I know it’s not true.
I’m so sorry.
It’s funny. I wanted them all here, but I feel relieved they’re starting to go. It’ll be nice when it’s just us.
Yeah.
Home on the ranch.

Pretty great view, huh? I meant out there. Not me.
 … but look Bob, we appreciate you coming over. Sure. Some people would insist on neutral territory. Turn everything into a mind-game.
Uh-huh.
Where are we at, Bob?
Excuse me. I’m not here. You’re at five-point-three?
Correct. And I think we can live with that?
Yeah? Yeah.
Uh-huh. It’s a fair price.
Oh yeah? That’s nice. What a lovely guy. Logan. You’ll have seventy local TV stations? Buy in Sandy’s. You’re King Kong of local. The kid knows. The kid’s smart. We good?
Can you give us five? We’ll set you up with a room.
Good, right? Is it whisky time?
Shut the fuck up.
Ugh? That’s a good price?
So what’s going on? He’s selling me things I want at a fair price? What’s next?
I think he wants out, fast.
So, if he does, we fuck him.
Dad. I think we did fuck him?
It’s no good if he’s smiling.
Well, objectively, I mean, if we get what we want and he gets what he wants—
You screw them out, you chisel them out, you fucking hurt them. You make them squeal.
Well, sure, I like hurting other human beings as much as the next guy but – this is, really fucking good, Dad.
Walk him to the elevator and tell him four-nine.",0.4052493248421412,0.5891179118018884,0.26532710624070693,0.35669927099862925,0.31233231343525963,0.32843175486016735,0.332663787707973,0.25073393878097144,0.4461948410178033,0.32568994760513303,0.17570787441934674,0.10456551651900205,0.19314085936460357,0.4773738970263646,0.41669393858800713,0.21166454085793632,0.28186220082526026,0.2510961980164911,0.16552171067495902
8,"Oh, Dad? That’s— It’s insulting.
Alright. Gerri, you go. If you can’t do it fuck off! Just text on your phone, you bendy fuck.
Hey. You okay, kiddo?
What – that? Oh that’s nothing.
Uh-huh?
I got game. Sometimes you play possum. Let him punch it out till he gets tired. Then, I move in for the kill.
Right. Nice. So – I’ve been wanting to ask. How’s Kendall?
He blowing you off too? Last time I saw him he was smoking crank with some mole men. But that was, like, a month back. He’s hustling.
Right, VC-ing?
I’m maybe seeing him this weekend. If he shows.
Yeah?
Fuck. Dude. I don’t suppose you know a coke dealer in Prague?
Um. Probably. Why?
Tom Wom bachelor party. Ugh. Ugh. I don’t have time for this shit!
Tell you what, dude, fuck Prague. My girlfriend and her freak dogs they run – you know these parties? Rhomboid?
Bullshit. Rhomboid?
Hey, I’m cool.
Please. Because you have a nipple ring and simply will   stop going on about it?
Better than telling everyone you’re ‘down with Dre’ because he sends you cereal bars at Christmas.
Fuck you, I have a reputation. I’m not taking my crew to watch, some art pricks and some tech hoes dance around in bowler hats and twizzle their mustaches out of time to the ‘beatz’. Dude. Come on. Not the lumbar setting.
You know who else’ll be there? Sandy Furness.
Really? Yuch. He goes to those things?
I know, right? But he’s sitting on the other half of your dad’s dream deal. Packet of fifty more local stations. Come to the party. Talk him into selling. Go home to Zeus like a triumphant fucking Hermes or someone. Does that make sense? I never read any of that shit.
Sandy goes? Jesus.
Dude. Send me the names, I’ll get you on the list. And bring Kendall yeah, I need to straighten things out.
Bro? How about some more bass in the back? I like to feel my teeth dance.
You okay, Ken?
I’m good. And listen, try not to drag yourself in there like the world’s oldest man, yeah? And try not to breathe so loud. Kendall. Frank. This is Dust.
‘Hey.’ Great to connect. Love the name, by the way. Very funky.
Please excuse Captain fucking Bee-Bop here. How’s it going? Nice shirt. Big fan of what you do. Fucking sweet potatoes. Thank you. Um. Likewise? Angela. Did you want to spin us through the pitch deck?
I don’t need to hear the pitch. Because I’ve X-rayed your business and I get how it works. You buy bullshit from idiots and you sell it to pricks. Art-school student makes a painting, you jack up the price, skim it, sell it on. We’re interested in increasing the reach of young artists.  … and the democratization of art.
No absolutely, I get it. You’re giving a platform to marginalized talent. I’m just telling you how this works from the outside, to the sharks. Maybe we should talk about funding cycles—
Look. Can I tell you something? I bought these on my way over here because I thought you’d like them and I’m passionate about working with you. Don’t sell your soul to some monolith. We’re boutique, we’re light on our feet. Fucking rebel alliance. I’m a good guy, who knows the bad guys and I’ll fight for you every day. I’m the asshole who can be your Warhol. And yeah, I just thought of that. So what? Do I take off my shoes? I will. I’ll throw them out the fucking window right now.
What do you think? I mean I’m somewhat between the devil and the deep blue sea here because, my boss downstairs, is like waiting, and yet my boss up here is. Him. And I’ve been here three and a half hours now. Do you have any advice?
Ugh. It’s the wheel.
It’s buffering. You could try knocking it down to low quality? There will be a minor loss of crispness. Wow. That’s a lot of browser tabs. But, then, you’re a busy guy.
I hear you boys are headed out for Tom’s bachelor party?
Yes. That’s correct. Roman’s arranging. Prague has been mentioned?
 … Logan Roy is a pernicious influence on our culture, he is, to be frank, a cancer to American values …
Man. That guy. What a – jackhole. Well. He just lost my vote.
Huh.
Got a really good head of hair there. Sorry to— But it’s the maternal side I think, that’s carried on. So! Good news for me!
So listen. This party. Can you make sure Kendall doesn’t come home in a box?
Okay?
I don’t want him showing up dead at the bottom of some French fag’s swimming pool.
Absolutely. None of us do, sir.
Keep an eye on him for me. Is that something you can do for me?
Yes, sir. In which case would now be a convenient time to talk with you about my position, because I’d like to move on from parks and into, for example, digital? I won’t mention any names but there’s a culture of— It can border on the personally abusive.
Tom? Tom can dish it out?
He’s pretty able in that department. All I’m doing is, I’m flagging to you that I’m thirsty for the next chapter.
Take care of this for me, perhaps we’ll talk.
Muchly appreciated. ‘ ’?
 … and it’s a wave, a wave that pushes up. It starts with the voters like you. And it rises and breaks over the powerful and says,  is where it starts. And today we’re calling time’s up. Time’s up on the big media owners who pervert the flow of true, pure, information. Contaminate it with their sour and bitter pollutants. Time’s up for Waystar Royco, and the shadow it casts across our national conversation. Time’s up for the man at the top of that pyramid – Logan Roy. The man who, it seems, will not rest until he has monopolized the provision of news in these United States.
You saw this?
ATN spot. Uh-huh. Yeah. I guess, we do? Right.
You’re going to stand right there? In my air space?
I am rereading for context.
You’re cc’d.
I can’t believe I get paid to call my dad names. It’s so cathartic.
You really think he should do ATN?
Sure. Into the lion’s den. He attacks them, righteous, Old Testament anti-capitalist Gil. They attack us, ‘there’s a red in the bed!’ No one’s mind’s getting changed. We get the base fired up. They get the viewers. Then, once we’re through the primaries, we pivot to center.
Gil won’t pivot.
I’ll get him to pivot. Hello?
So listen, something’s afoot. I’ve arrived at the drop-off point and it seems there’s been a change of plan— I’m pretty sure I’m being pranked.
What’s happening, Roman?
Just – hold your tingling wieners. All will become clear.
I’m not sure you understand how disruptive it is to be changing the itinerary at this late stage—
And I don’t know what’s going to happen but – you know, I have a feeling it’s all liable to get a little ‘disgusting’ and—
Pretty sure you’re not supposed to be telling me this, Tom?
I just wanted to flag it. And calm the qualms. Because I for one—
Tom. We’re adults. It’s one night. Enjoy yourself.
Shiv …  ? Honey badger?   I want to dock myself inside you so much right now.
I love you too, Tom.
Oh, okay.   he deigns to join us. You’re late.
Yeah well. Apologies. I’ve been a little busy revolutionizing tech financing.
 … On coke.
Okay, what is this, Roman?
Alright! Who wants to fuck a hobo? No? Then let’s roll out. Party. Down there.
Wait, what? We’re going to a party in a tunnel?
Relax. We’re not going to a party in the tunnel. It’s a ruse.
What is this? Some pop-up shit?
Am I going to need my central Europe coat?
Rome, what now? I’m wearing flight socks and my TSA slip-ons. C’mon!
I get what’s happening here. One minute I’m getting lured into a tunnel, next thing I wake up in Belgium with no eyebrows.
You should probably dump your luggage in the car. And listen, I’m really sorry, guys – but it’s a pretty tight guest list?
Oh. Roman, what? Matt and Jonas? The Fly Guys aren’t …? They flew in. The old team? Roman?
Relax, we’ll figure it out. Keep your phones on, we’ll first-wave it and call you once we’re inside. Take twenty for coffee.
Thanks.
I can buy a coffee.
Gah. Oh! I can’t leave Team Fly Guy. That’s the Fly Guy code? Keep your phones on yeah? I’ll call you! Five minutes. Five.
Oh, man. What the fuck have you got planned for me, Roman? Seriously. What have you got planned?
Look. Tom, I’m sorry. Prague fell through and I was busy and I didn’t have time to organize a – hot-air balloon to Monaco.
Okay … ‘Hot-air balloon …’?
I just stepped on a snail. Oh god. I hate stepping on snails.
Roman, do you know where you’re going?
Yeah. I came to another thing here.
Ugh. This is a disaster on the footware front. Can I change? Guys? Stop for a shoe change?
You kept your luggage?
Be prepared. I know Roman. And I love him. But I don’t trust him. He’s a twenty-four-karat dingbat.
So, bro. Are you going to be okay to be around all the booze and coke? Because, I can make sure no one does it around you, man.
I’ll be fine, man. Thank you.
I hear you’re ‘doing apps’.
Uh-huh. I’m incubating. I’ve been out on the west coast sprinkling fuck-dust. Rebalancing away from crypto, into eco.
Wow. It’s all so futuristico.
Better than being carried around in Dad’s pockets like fucking Stuart Little—
Hey. They’re nice pockets. Spacious.
How is he? Still using your fragile self-esteem as a punchbag?
He’s actually got me overseeing this satellite launch out of Tanegashima.
Wow. A spaceship?
Plus I’m heading up the local deal. Bob Galpin’s selling and I knocked it out the park. Which was nice.
Good for you, bro.
Guess I finally broke out the cage. ‘Can’t keep a good dog down,’ right, bro? Okay! Abandon all hope, ye who enter!
Is this real? Is this a real corridor? Are we at an airfield?
Yeah Willa moved out to Austerlitz. And she loves it. She loves how quiet it is. She didn’t think she would but she really does. So. Girlfriend. I guess I for one won’t be partaking in any debauchery. Roman Roy and guests? Welcome to Rhomboid.
Okay, boys, we’re pouching.
Wait – how are we going to phone the Fly Guys?
Tom, we’ll figure it out. I think the big white men are going to be drinking   of diner coffee. What’s in the luggage, sir?
It’s a variety of winter wear. You can leave that with us.
Okay so this way …
Wait … So this is it …? This is   where I’m going for my bachelor party?
It smells of – ammonia. And, like, the inside of handbags? If you’re at all familiar with that smell?
The tough thing is I’ve been living on central European time for forty- eight hours, to ease the transition. So I’ll be ready for breakfast soon.
It doesn’t look like the sort of party with a lot of food?
Roman. I’m sorry – am I having my bachelor party in a very large, very cold sort of – pretend rail yard?
Hey, Rome. Ken?! How you going?!
Stewy?
Bro. Long time. You look like shit. What you up to, working at Starbucks and growing the coverage? We good?
You’re my third oldest friend and you fucked me like a tied goat. We’re great.
Let me show you up.
Oh and Kendall. If you need anything this evening. Bottle of water, soft drink – I’m more than happy to be your mule on the whole soft- beverage side of things? Okay?
So, dude, where’s Sandy? When do we sit?
All things in time.
No. I’m sure it’ll be great. Thanks, Roman.
What did you expect? Why did you even ask me, Tom?
I thought you’d rise to the occasion.
Well clearly I haven’t risen to the occasion.
One second – Kendall, I’ll find you.
Okay. This is it. Yeah? Cool right? Is it cool? Or is it like total fucking bullshit? Who knows?
What is this?
It’s a physical fun palace. It’s if you like it and she likes it, it’s all good. Uh, this guy – look at the fucking bird mask like it’s  .
Wait –  — Is this – gonna be an orgy?
No.
It’s not gonna be an orgy?
Greg. It’s not 1997. It’s not this and it’s not that. Don’t be so binary, Mr Betamax.
So it’s – it’s a bit of an orgy?
It’s basically a collective of hot people – and Connor. At a party. With a monkey dressed as an astronaut. It’s whatever you want it to be. It’s a fucking – sandpit for emergent behaviors.
Okay! Okay. Holy shit. So can we, are we going to be able to – fuck here?
Not me, business is my fucking.
Sure. Maybe we could find you a Bloomberg terminal to stick your cock in?
Well, I’m out. In a relationship. Girlfriend!
Well I have to say, Roman. This is promising! This is very promising!
See, Tom? How about a little faith?
But there’s areas though? Neutral areas? It’s not— In the sense of it being compulsory.
Angela? Dust? Yeah? Hey? Oh – fuck? Hey. What’s happening?
We just got here. Cool. Very cool. Totally. Same. This is actually only like the third time I ever did this, so.
This must be synchronicity, huh? Two people meet in a warehouse and the fucking world changes? Oh. Yeah. And we really appreciated you coming to see us—
I’m super-excited. Oh. Totally. Me too.
Well, you have a great night, Angela.
So maybe – one water, one wine? As a kind of informal rule for the group? Plus, they have risotto balls?! Soakers. Super-soakers.
Can I help you with something, Greg?
Man. It is going off tonight like Wambs, gans, thank you ma’ams! We should go talk to some girls.
Little tip. Ask them where they were on 9/11. If they can’t remember, they could be under twenty-one.
Shiv gave me a hall pass. ‘We’re adults.’ Apparently. I’m going to blow my stack, like, multiple times!
And what, Shiv? Shiv has the same arrangement. She’s an adult too?
What? No! I mean. Sure. I – I don’t know. Greg, it’s not a competition.
No, it’s cool. I’m sure you’ve got it all figured out.
What’s this?
Molly. Happy pills. Con man. C’mon. No?
What? Prague time. It’s two in the morning for me. I need a pick-me- up. Dude, I know my way round. 1986. Me and a Fleetwood Mac LP and a bag of weed touched the face of God! First of the evening! First of many!
Connor. Do not do any more of these.
Got it. I am one and done.
So. How does it feel to be out?
Not going to lie. Great. Seeing the kids. Growing kale. Following my nose. Intrigued by vegan meat.
And about the vote and your dad, you know I had to follow the money, right?
I get it. Friends are friends but money’s money.
Exactly. And, listen. Here’s a question. How would you feel about getting all the way out? Half a bil for your share of Waystar.
Hello?
I know. I’m feeling generous. I’ve plumped the pillows, added a little premium. Can you get me one of these but without any of this? Thank you, I’ll be right here.
Consisting of what?
Straight liquid.
Bullshit.
Don’t worry about that. I can raise it.
Why would you want to be even more in? The place is a fucking antique shop.
Ken. Just take the money and get out.
Well. It’s not uninteresting. Because I’ve got a lot cooking. An artificial sun. Clean beef made in the lab.
Great. So listen. Part two. How would you feel about talking about this with Sandy?
Sandy Furness? Excuse me, what the fuck?
These bathrobes are nice. You should ask for these.
Uh-huh.
What’s your table-linen philosophy?
My philosophy is I literally don’t give a fuck. So what’s that, Nietzsche?
Silverware. These are what we have on our registry. You should go for these.
You want us to have matching cutlery?
Why not? It’d be sort of horrible and cute.
Right what and then when we get divorced and split all the stuff, we can hook up and still have the full set?
Uh-huh.
You know this is just fun, right?
I know. This is just—
Nothing. I mean there’s no God, and there’s no – anything. So there’s just people, trying to be happy, in rooms. Right?
Right.
And you know I’m suggesting to Gil, on ATN, he cools off on the anti-Waystar agenda.
Er. Excuse me?
I talked to him after the thing.
Oh. Okay, well, I have spent quite some time on how it would be ‘very vivid’ to attack Waystar on a Waystar network.
It’s played out. It looks like we have an agenda.
Er, we do. Stopping overly mighty media owners setting the agenda for our democracy. DOJ, FCC, Batman to stop your dad eating the news.
Uh-huh? Even if we’re going for that, isn’t it in a big important speech nobody reads? Tonight he can forget the base and connect with America.
Shiv, I appreciate you might have split loyalties on this—
Fuck you. I just want him to win.
I’m just not sure he can do both at once. The base, and the rest.
If you can’t ride two horses at once, you shouldn’t be working at the circus.
Sandy comes to these things?
Oh yeah. The thing about Sandy? He   sex. I know. Gross. He takes the thing that he pees through and he puts it into other people. It’s disgusting.
Kendall. You look well.
Thank you. You look – incredibly out of place. So. You wanted to talk?
Has Stewy filled you in …  ?
Why do I feel like I’m about to find out you’re not my real mommy and daddy after all?
Look, the truth is he wants your piece of pie, but – and I don’t want you to blow a fuse, but he’s already in on Waystar.
As in?
Sandy’s me, I’m Sandy. We’re kind of a single entity. Like a creature from mythology. Head of a horse, dick of a swan.
Seriously? Stewy? Jesus Christ.
I have a shell company attached to his private equity fund. I’m a parasite on a parasite.
You obviously should have disclosed this to me when I brought you in. You acted like kind of a snake?
And you acted like kind of a sap, so, quits?
You were in a tough position without having to consider whether your dad would want me … involved.
He very much would not.
So apparently my girlfriend’s having a panic attack – so I’m going to let you two catch up.
Stewy tells me you’re getting into tech.
I have a fund. We’re small but we’re engaged. Only work with good people. I’m interested in adopting an ethical posture.
Half a billion. Smart guy could make a pretty big difference …
Just closed a deal tonight. Also there’s these four Stanford grads, they have a piece of proprietary tech, it’s a cluster of hydrogen lamps in a honeycomb formation and it makes a kind of artificial sun—
Wait. What’s going on …? Dude. Are you pitching? Did you just pitch?
Where’d you spring from, Heidi?
Don’t stop. I want to hear the big pitch. I might invest.
We were just talking.
To him? The enemy? Dude? He’s doing apps now. Did he say? He has this dry-cleaning one. It’s going to revolutionize the way we get grease spots out of ‘chinos’.
Rome? The adults are talking. How about you go play in the other room?
Sandy, could we maybe get a moment in private? Because I’d like to talk to you about how attached you’re feeling to your fifty failing local TV stations?
Sure. I’m sure we can find a time …
Roman. Could you maybe back off for like twenty minutes?
I’m good thanks, Kendall.
Maybe just dial it in like  . Get us a drink.
Haha. No.
I would love another old fashioned.
Look I know you and my dad are deeply and happily in hate and have been for many years – but I need you to know, I’m my own thing. And I’m fully authorized to negotiate on Logan’s behalf.
‘Logan’.
I’m actually overseeing telecoms.
He’s doing satellites like it’s 1985. Dad’s got him holding the plastic wheel in the back and telling him he’s driving.
You’ll have to excuse my brother, he’s making some adjustments right now and he’s a little ‘off-center’.
How about you fuck off back to your little gangbang?
You see this? How he talks to me?
You’re embarrassing yourself.
Family.
You know he used to lock me in a cage?
What the fuck?
Back when we were younger. True story. What? You pretending you don’t remember the Dog Pound?
You’re tripping.
It was a game, I had to climb into the big Alsatian cage in the kitchen and wait for someone to come collect me.
Oh yeah …? I don’t know—
Might be three minutes, might be the whole afternoon. Four years old. Eating dog food from a cold tin bowl.
You need to stop talking.
Pissed myself in there once. He just gave me some newssheet and told me to mop it up. I know, right? They should make a fucking movie about this shit.
Excuse me, I’ll be back.
What the fuck are you doing?
What?
What was that bullshit?
Oh, I can’t— I can say what I want.
Yeah but you— That was – that was insane.
You want me to pretend none of it happened?
What happened?
So none of that happened? The Dog Pound?
Okay. I never made you eat dog food.
There was a bowl and it was filled with chow and I had to stay in there until it was finished.
It was a game. You enjoyed it. Ask Connor, ask Shiv.
I enjoyed being in a cage for three hours with a leash around my neck. Sure.
So now there’s a leash. You’re full of shit.
That’s right, Kendall. Me.   the piece of shit. Enjoy the party, asshole.
Have you seen Kendall? Because I feel like we should maybe keep an eye on him?
—Austerlitz. It’s in New Mexico. And we recycle all our rainwater. Oh yeah? That’s awesome!
Hey Con, can I ask you something?
Roman this is Amy and she’s amazing. So smart. I really like her.
Dude? That’s the drugs talking.
No, I really don’t think it is. I think we have a real connection, you know?
Trust me, it’s the drugs.
It really isn’t. We’re just really relaxed in each other’s company. She held my hand. I think I’m in love.
For fuck’s sake, you’re not in love, man.
The only problem is I’m in love with Willa. So I can’t be in love with Amy and in love with Willa. I mean, Willa’s amazing and Amy’s amazing maybe we can all be amazing together.
Sure. On your Mormon sex ranch. Look, do you remember anything about the Dog Pound from growing up?
I remember something about a game you used to play.
So he did? He used to lock me in a cage?
Sure. The big cage. In the laundry room. At your mom’s place in Cheltenham.
Right? What a bastard.
No, you liked it. You used to ask to go in the cage.
What?
Yeah, it was weird but I think you enjoyed it.
Okay. So I ‘asked’ to eat dog food?
It was chocolate cake. I think?
Bullshit. Kendall locked me in a cage, I went all fucking weird, started pissing the bed and that’s why Dad sent me away to St Andrew’s.
Rome, Dad sent you away to military school because you saw  you started marching up and down the hallway with a placard saying, ‘Send me away to military school.’
You’re full of shit.
Well, that’s how I remember it. Seriously. It’s safe from biological and chemical attack and you’d all be welcome, pre- or post-apocalypse.
I’d like to unsheathe please. Go bareback.  –
Hello …  ? No, I’m happy with my current provider thank you.
I’m just checking in …
Tom, sweetheart, listen, I’m at ATN with Gil, what is the least number of syllables you think you can say this in?
Yeah, just so we’re clear – in terms of you and me. Is this a quid pro quo arrangement?
What are you talking about, Tom?
Because if I for instance, touch a boob, do you grab a dick?
Um. I don’t know if—
Is there a rough chart of comparison? Like Celsius to Fahrenheit? Or is it an eye for an eye, an orifice for an orifice? I’m just trying to get a sense of the parameters?
Tom. I can’t negotiate right now. Just— We know, right? We know.
Right. No sure, we know.
You want to run the tree on how personal stuff plays?
Issues. Issues issues issues. I can handle the soft soap, Shiv.
Hey, Kendall, just spoken to Shiv. Official permission for having of the fun!
Amazing. So happy for you.
Frank, so listen, I’ve had an approach. Very interesting approach and I wanted to get your brain on it—
I heard from the girls. The Dust thing. With the art?
I know. I saw them. It’s locked down.
They wanted you to know, they loved you in the room but …
Frank. I just spoke to the girl.
Ken. They’re already setting this up elsewhere. But like I say, they loved you in the room …
What are you talking about?
I think there’s other money and they like it better.
Then we match it.
I already tried. But seriously, they loved you in the room—
Stop telling me they loved me in the fucking room. Frank. Let me talk to her, I can fix this.
Can we talk for a second? Could we do this another time?
I just got off the phone to Frank. He told me. I’m sorry. It’s nothing personal—
Listen. And I shouldn’t be telling you this, but I’m about to land a chunk of seed capital the size of fucking – Idaho so whatever it is you need I can make it happen, okay? Okay.
Okay? We good? Yeah, it’s just, not about that.
Then? Help me out here. Because there’s something I’m not seeing— It’s the name.
Which – Dust? Roy. Kendall Roy. It’s like I was marrying Hitler and then what? I’d get to be – Mrs Hitler?
Okay. I get it. But that’s not me. I’m not a Roy. Not really. I’m sorry, it’s cool. We just don’t want to be ‘Hitler Incorporated’. You’re a—
I’m solid, I’m a good guy. Well consensus is you’re a coked-up prick who can’t shit straight. You think you’re different, you’re the same poison in new sneakers?
Angela. Okay. I’m going to be frank with you— Look. I didn’t want to do this here. And I may be being more forthright cos of the coke. I definitely seem to get more forthright on coke I’m sorry—
Hey, wait— Hey fuck off.
Hey, man, can I get in on that? I’m joined in the studio by Senator Gil Eavis. Firstly, Senator, welcome. We appreciate it.
Happy to be here, Sharon. Let’s jump straight in if we may? Your wife very tragically took her own life eighteen months ago.
The warmest of ATN welcomes.
Soft-core. Horrible but easy.
Um. I think everyone knows about that and it’s something I live with but isn’t relevant in terms of the issues I want to— The impression you’ve given is that it did inform your decision to run?
A lot of things inform a big decision like this. What I want to talk about is— It hasn’t been long and I guess what some people will ask is, what could possibly have caused such a tragedy and are you ready so suddenly to turn around and run for the highest office?
Doesn’t he have a line for this?
It’s normally – it’s normally good.
What I’m focussed on what I think this country needs to do— But it’s something you think about? Your mental and emotional state?
Yes. Sharon. I think about my feelings. Like most humans.
No. No jokes. Nate?
Yeah. I don’t know. Can we change channels on this? It must be incredibly difficult for you, especially someone who has had to deal with rumors swirling around the state of their mental health.
You know, instead of playing a pretend game of sympathy where you’re trying to get your viewers to ask: ‘What sort of guy has a wife who kills herself?’— That’s not what I said—
Maybe we should talk about the guy who owns this channel, your boss, the owner of ATN, who’s trying to buy up local news networks all over the country – so I’m calling for this deal to be blocked by the FCC, and for the DOJ to launch an in-depth investigation …
Is this okay?
I don’t— It doesn’t feel great? I’m going hot and cold so fast I think I might have hit the fucking menopause. Would you say your emotional outbursts here could suggest you’re not emotionally ready, temperamentally ready, to seek to lead the free world?
If you wanna make this personal let’s talk about Logan Roy. Your paymaster who has presumably sent you in as a hatchet woman? Oh come on.
Because you can tell a lot about someone from their relationship with their family.
Oh fuck.
I feel sick.
Then you should puke. We could use the distraction.
His only daughter has come to work for me. What does that tell you about the man? You’ve got a hot temper haven’t you, Gil Eavis? You don’t want to take any more questions, is that it?
They knew. They knew we were coming for them.
Okay, wait. No, Kendall …  ?
What is it with you and him? You’ve been up his ass all day. Are you trying to fuck him?
No I just – I just want to make sure—
Make sure what?
Roman – excuse me— It’s not anything.
Is something going on, Greg? Because I can see inside your brain. And if anything’s obscured. I’ll pull your fingers off.
If I say, you will keep it to yourself?
Yes.
You won’t tell him will you?
Absolutely not.
Okay. Your dad – I think he’s worried about him – he asked me to keep an eye on him?
Hey, Kendall! Dad asked Greg to keep an eye on you.
Wait – he’s been   on me?
He just – I think he was concerned.
Okay. Well. I’m about to do these four lines of coke and then my heart’s going to explode so if you want to stop me—
But that’s like— I don’t get involved in the white drugs.
Or maybe you want to explain to my dad how you let his son OD?
Come on …?
What are you gonna do, cuz? He’s counting on you, Greg. He’s counting on you to look after me.
Yeah go for it, Greg! Suck on those big white dicks, you fucking pervert! Holy shit, cuz! You greedy piece of shit!
And now I guess I have to go find some more.
That is – strong – drugs. I need to— Should I puke?
Unless you can puke up your bloodstream? Oh, man, I hope you don’t die! Cos if you do your heart’ll be pumping so hard it’ll probably bring you back to life and then you’re just in a vicious circle of dying and briefly reanimating! Buckle up, fucklehead!
Hello, Pinky. Glad you kept the date.
Well. Family. How was the play?
You know. People pretending to be people. How are the wedding preparations?
Very exciting.
Well I am excited. My daughter.
You saw the interview?
They told me.
You came after the man’s wife.
They said.
And you’re happy with that?
Well tell him not to speak about my family. Not on my network and not on any network, ever again, or I’ll end him.
So – silence the man who says you’re stifling dissent?
I’m a bad father? How dare he? He’s a bad husband. He killed his fucking wife.
What if your acquisitions are bad for the country?
Meh meh meh. Men change the world. Cowards complain. He’s using you. Can’t you see it? Don’t let a lot of bullshit overshadow the wedding okay?
The fucking wedding? I don’t care about—
C’mon, stop screwing around. Let’s talk. Come in. I’m tired of this. You have potential. I always thought you were the smartest.
So that’s why you tried Kendall and Roman first? You know what – I am the smartest. Which is why I can see through you and this transparent little offer to buy me off.
You know, I’ve always taken care of you, Siobhan, and maybe I shouldn’t have. Maybe I should just let them come for you.
Like what?
I hear things, Siobhan.
Okay. You know what, Dad? If this is the way things are going—
Well then I’m truly sorry.
—and in terms of Shiv, where I’ve landed is – I think I’m going to maybe just ask for a ‘handy’?
Tom. Don’t  rationalize. You get off and you eat the shame for dessert. Wait. Her? This one?
Yeah. We were talking for twenty minutes about financial derivatives and then she just asked me?
My god. Holy shit. Dad would go absolutely nuts for her. You should do it.
Yeah?
Man. I’d be all over her. I’d like— I’d fucking –  . Oh yeah.
Okay. I need a Smint. Do you have anything?
Tom. Just grab your baloney-pipe and jizz.
So is now a good time to sit down with the old geezer?
Soon. Did you see the projection with all the plastic in the Pacific?
So when can I talk to him? Because I would love to secure something to take home?
Romey. Be cool. Maybe eat a slider, ask if you can stick your finger in someone’s ass—
You know what – fuck you. I’m not your little pet that you get to kick around. You think I can’t make life difficult for you? Word in the right ear, I can be your migraine, motherfucker. I came here to talk to the old man. On your word. So make it happen.
Okay, okay.
I tried to hide but it finds you. Wherever you hide, the party finds you. Sir, this is your final warning.
Absolutely. Got it. Understood.
What’s happening? Your friend keeps telling people he’s in love with them. And it’s making people uncomfortable.
My bad. Mixed messages, we just share such strong feelings on gut bacteria I think I got the wrong end of the stick.
Oh my god, dude. That was 
Oh yeah?
Maybe I should go apologize …? Give her a hug …?
Me and this girl. Went into a side room. Made out for a while, I was touching her, she goes down on me, I just splooge in her mouth. I know! Then – get this – she kisses me, and puts it back into my mouth, I swallow.
Which – the splooge?
I know. So hot.
You swallowed your own load?
Because I’ve heard about it but I never knew it actually happened.
Oh yeah? Because I haven’t heard of it.
Yeah. There’s a word for it. I can’t remember it right now. So fucking hot.
When are we allowed to go home?
We have cars at five. Greg. I am having the time of my life.
Are you ready for your bachelorette party? They were out of marine uniforms so I’ve come dressed as a political consultant. Relax. This isn’t real.
Can I stay? But – with you – just as a human dog at the foot of the bed?
I’ll be your dog.
Hey, brother. I’m looking for this girl but I think she might be hiding from me.
Connor. Not right now.
Is there another room, you know, for humping? Because I’ve also lost Roman.
Forget Roman.
Yeah? Cos he was asking about the Dog Pound and he got kinda riled up.
Uuh. He’s still talking about that? Pathetic. He enjoyed it, right?
Sure. I mean, so did you. You’d give him a real good whack on the snout. With the Sunday magazine.
Well, rough house.
You know, Dad’s theory was. You got two fighting dogs. You send the weak one away. You punish the weaker one. Then everyone knows the hierarchy and everyone’s happy. So away he went. Hey. So, can I ask? Where were you on 9/11?
Hey, listen, Sandy. I appreciate your offer, I’m not getting out.
Okay. Well if you think you’re going to tell your father, get back in with him, I have—
Keep your money, bring me in. We do this properly.
Uh-huh?
Takeover. Leveraged buy-out.
A dual stock situation. That’s not going to be straightforward.
Price in the toilet, shareholders are pissed. You and me could force him to the table.
What about the rest of the family?
Fuck the rest of the family.
Easy to say?
No one has a clue but me. I can see it all. We take it apart. Fuck local TV, newspapers, parks. We bulldoze the whole fucking shanty town. I just keep the juiciest morsels. Turn the thing from a pod of rotting whales into one bastard great white.
What’s your end?
CEO.
Don’t hold back.
I’m the only one who knows the architecture. The – emotional and corporate architecture.
Well I could like it. Stewy might not like it?
Fuck Stewy. He’ll follow the money like a dog in a cartoon.
And you’re sure you’ve got the stomach?
Yeah. I’m good.
Tom …?
Sorry to wake you.
Is everything okay?
He couldn’t catch his breath. We’ve taken advice. We’re sorry but we think it might not be a good idea for him to come to the wedding.
Uh-huh. I think that’s sensible.
Shiv. He really is sorry.
Me too.
Are you okay?
I’m great. Two less wedding dinners for the caterers. I don’t know Nate. I don’t fucking know.
—and I’d be the pointman on this, you wouldn’t even have to deal direct with my dad. So if we can find a price— But there’s potential?
It could work.
I’m excited. This is pure upside, for both of us. —
Let’s jerk him around for a bit then throw him back. This fucking family.
Bro. How it’s going? What? Oh. Are you psyching me out, bro? Ooh. I’m terrified. Asshole.
If the car doesn’t come soon I’m just going to swim home.
Greg tells me you swallowed your own load.
Yeah. It was – it was pretty wild. It’s cool because it’s kind of like I didn’t cheat? Because all the sperm stayed in my body? Like a closed-loop system. Be really nice to see Shiv.
Hey Willa, I just wanted to say – I love you. I love you so much.
What’s happening?
We have cars arriving in five.
Congratulations. I hear you swallowed your own load.
I did.
It’s been a really wonderful night.
I wanted to apologize.
Oh. This is new.
I shouldn’t have brought you into it.
You know what? I don’t care if you use my name— but the truth is, you don’t need to. He’s scared of us.
Got it.
Gil? Well, this is socially uncomfortable. Hey … Yeah …? What just now …? So what did she say …? Okay, interesting …
Hey, Shiv? I’m home! And I still have both my eyebrows!
Oh. You’re back already? I was just—
God honey, I’ve missed you—
How was it?
Which? Oh. The party? Yeah it was a – blast.
So what happened?
You know. This and that. The usual. Normal stuff.
Specifically what, Tom?
Wait. Shiv? Because I thought you said—
I’m shitting you, Tom. It’s good to have you back.
Hey, listen I had an idea – what do you think about this? As you know since I read that thing, I’m a feminist. Well why don’t I take your name instead of you taking mine? Tom and Shiv Roy? What do you think?
So, Tom? Listen, you know the toxic thing that you know about that I told you I didn’t want to know about?
Oh yeah?
I think, one way and another, I’m ready to know about it now.
? Those girls from the art thing …? I want you to put the word around – they’re junkies, they’re flakes, they’re shooting seed capital straight into their arms. Let’s sink them.
Okay. Here they are! Will that make it through?
I don’t think they will make it through, will they?
Well don’t ask me. You’re the wedding planner, Charlotte – is this part of the plan? Hey! Hey!!
Come on. Come on down! This is not the welcome I intended.
We’ll sort it out, Tom. If you wait here we’ll buggy or car you to the accommodation!
Hey hey hey! How the fuck long is that going to take?
Not long. I can round up some buggies.
I work in hospitality, Charlotte, and I can smell the bullshit. I’m going to remain calm but this is a major issue right here. Huge! Dad! Hey hey hey! Mom? You okay?
Absolutely, Tom! Wonderful.
Good ride? You like it?
Fantastic. Couple of hours at the airfield, waiting for the gang, but yes. Yes. Great to be here.
Couple of hours?
It was wonderful just sitting there. We liked watching the planes. Your father thought he might have seen the man from U2?
And Arthur Laffer. You know, of the Laffer curve? Are they coming?
Uh-huh, sounds right, it’s mostly rock gods and economists! Hey hey it’s the Fly Guys!
Your mother is a little thirsty is the only thing?
I don’t want to be a bother, Tom. It’s my fault.
Oh, Mom. Say, you should say. I hope you’re pleased, Charlotte, my mother’s dying of thirst. And I’m picking up a case. I am carrying a case on My Wedding Eve.
Listen, I’m going to have to go. I’ll see you there, you’ve got the change from Sarah about the time for the embassy— Sorry, are we okay?
Yup.
You don’t have to come down to the wedding, Gil, if you’re busy?
We’ve just been doing the media monitoring?
Motherfucker! I’ll fucking kill him. I’ll take them to pieces.
He’s not sleeping. It was what’s-his-name Screwdriverface. He’s got under his skin.
The – the – the bit—
The bit that implied he murdered his wife. Yeah, for some reason that has ‘somewhat irked him’?
Gil, let us hit that, you need to—
I know. I know, I’m focussed. I’m focussed. I’m X-raying this briefing for salient facts. I mean I don’t want to get this out of proportion but – is it possible your father is the worst human being who has ever lived?
I really don’t think it’s good to focus on—
Is it true he’s not coming to the wedding out of – spite?
Well – it’s complicated—
I want to take him out. I want to destroy ATN.
I’m not sure that’s wise.
And if I said it was wise. Would you have a problem with that?
In the end, I’ll do whatever you want, Gil.
My son. Probably intrigued to hear whether his father might have murdered his mother?
He’ll calm down.
If there’s something – anything you can get, Shiv, I’m in a fucking knife fight holding a dildo made of American cheese.
Your sister knows about Lake Como, right? She knows Venice exists and Cape Town and the Maldives? She is aware of these locations?
How we doing?
But she just what – she’s got a thing for fallen empires?
I got the call. You get the call?
We’re putting together a hostile takeover of one of the largest media corporations in the world. I   it might be worth braving some non- vintage champagne to keep it discreet?
I got the call. Canadians are in. A bottle of champagne please.
So what ten days and we go in for the kill? We can’t keep it on lockdown for more than about ten days, right?
John. Have we got any champagne?
So like the seventeenth for the bear hug? Ten days till the end of the world. Good?
There’s just one little thing. The Canadians? There’s just a little static about some details.
Like what?
Like – you as CEO, just, some queries. But I think it’s good.
We’ve not got champagne. I can do a white wine spritzer?
Relax. This doesn’t work without you. It’s normal co-investor shit. It’s just positioning? I’ll deal. Probably looking for a board seat.
If you tried to fuck me, I’d kill you.
Good, and if you tried to fuck me I’d kill you too, that’s why we’re such good friends.
Frank knows the Canadians, you want me to …?
I’ll handle, okay? No leaks. Why you so jumpy about this, Ken?
Why am I jumpy? About screwing Rome, screwing Shiv and Connor? Probably – blowing what’s left of my dad’s fucking brain? About taking the company out of family control, forever? I don’t know, Stewy, why would that make me jumpy?
Look, I don’t give a fuck.
But I mean, do you want me to ask?
I’m just curious if she’s going to come begging.
Okay. Because I can ask?
I don’t want to ask. If she wants to ask she can ask.
Because I can physically see her?
Do   ask, Gerri, okay? If she comes crawling, then I’ll think about coming. What’s going on? Have you seen Caroline? Is she still with that chinless hippy prick?
I don’t know. Everyone’s just arriving. The castle is currently being invaded.
I thought we might miss the rehearsal!
We don’t need to rehearse, we’re gonna kill it.
And have you thought again about your dad and if maybe we want to reconsider and—?
Fuck him.
Right. Right. And whether we want to go Wambsgans? Roy- Wambsgans or, as I’ve said, I would be willing to drop traditional and go Roy myself – in fact—
Look, I know this is kind of weird timing, but there’s something I need to ask … to clear up.
Uh-huh?
I could do with knowing about the bad thing, in cruises, you know the thing that meant you couldn’t sleep?",0.39298721080395715,0.5910671495401593,0.2524678457750758,0.3395518881612833,0.2677736337168087,0.32883247001958427,0.30786940109318317,0.25490065089274033,0.44099823696844614,0.33238278034685265,0.1693319302198213,0.0762519695830389,0.186385712739247,0.4863433625979988,0.4334152230528989,0.2153374531737237,0.2413996860559564,0.2828125362145478,0.1557943531458219
9,"Uh-huh?
No?
I just think, maybe, Church and State, AC/DC, Ebony and Ivory, never the twain shall meet?
Right but you always wanted to make it public, didn’t you?
Yup. In my bones I did.
Exactly.
But I did then destroy all the evidence. So?
I guess, if it’s bad, the longer you leave it the worse it will be when it comes out?
Uh-huh. Unless, it, you know never comes out?
I bet it’s not even that bad!
It is quite bad.
How about you just tell me? Then I’ll be in a good position to judge what you should do with the information?
Uh-huh. I mean I guess right now,   in a good position to judge what to do with the information? This isn’t very weddingy? Look. If I tell you everything, then you feel you have to tell Gil everything, then Gil feels he has to tell the world everything then, what people might say is, ‘Let’s sack the head of the division of where these terrible things happened.’ And that’s me. Honey. Really. Let’s not let this spoil things?
Oh fuck, here we go.
It’s exciting!
Hey. Did you talk to the Wicked Witch of the North yet?
I just got here, Shiv. Is this going to take long?
Shall we? Oh fuck. Saddle up, soldier!
Oh c’mon she can’t be that bad!
Hello hello hello! Here they are! I knew they’d come eventually.
Hi, hi, Mom.
Tom. Well look at you! Very plausible.
Oh, well— Thank you?
Exactly.
Hi, Mom.
Hello ‘Kendall’.
Bro.
Woof woof.
Right, well, shall we all play happy families? Well done on Tom.
Thank you.
Tell me again why you’re marrying him?
Mom?
I’m joking! I like him. And I wanted to say, I hope this can be nice. I appreciate you coming here.
No worries, my travel agent specializes in guilt trips.
Hey! Apologies, did I miss anything?
Caroline Collingwood. Pleased to meet you.
Likewise I’m sure – your – excellency. Greg Hirsch.
Greg – Egg?
Excuse me?
Are you Greg the Egg? When you were born you looked like a little misshapen egg?
Er – I think I did – hear tell of such—
Your dad tried to sleep with every man in Sausalito?

How’s your mother?
Er, doing okay. Solvent, currently. Thank you, ma’am.
Oh my god, Tom! Did you see?
What, Greg?
The girl from Red Hook. From your bachelor party, who sucked your dick and made you swallow your load!
Greg, that’s not very weddingy. She’s called Tabitha and her and Roman are dating, which is cool, so please do not act like an unsophisticated rube.
Oh, okay? Wow.
He really liked her and it’s fine – just one of those weird urban things. Like when you go to see stand-up and the comedian is your dentist? Yeah? Okay?
Er – hey, Shiv, listen, good news. I got my lump hammer out and broke some shin bones and I got the launch moved. It’s on. We can throw it large at the party?
Excuse me?
My satellite launch. I thought it would be cool – and Tom said—
Um, no I did not.
Tom?
I said we’d discuss, but Shiv’s been very busy— which is fine.
C’mon, don’t be a fucking witch about this?
No. Absolutely not.
Fine. I’m kidding. Let’s discuss.
Willa. Connor’s – partner.
Fantastic and what do you do, Willa?
I’m actually a playwright?
Fantastic. America! And what do you do, Connor?
Um – Connor doesn’t really do anything, do you, Con?
I think we’re all gathered now, Patrick?
Okay and – just to get things straight. Am I right that the father, I understand the father is—?
He couldn’t be bothered. I’m joking!
He’s not well.
That’s the story, everyone remember the story!
So I will be performing the father role.
Great. And Charlotte’s taken you through the big picture but let’s get into the details shall we?
Can someone brief me?
It won’t take long?
I’ll wing it, I swear, if I stand in the wrong place tomorrow – shoot me. Frank. I need to see you.
I didn’t mean that you don’t do  .
Well that’s a shame, because that’s what you said?
You know? I meant nothing like my writing? Nothing kind of—
Safeguarding thirty thousand acres of wilderness? That’s ‘nothing’.
Con?
Being on the verge of setting up a podcast on Napoleonic history with a considerable level of investment interest? That’s ‘nothing’?
Sure, no.
‘Cracking the nut of happiness’. Like a modern-day Thoreau? Oh  ‘nothing’?
Con. You’re great. You are.
Well, here we are. ‘The family pile’. The thorn in Caroline’s side. The fish bone in her throat. When we were kids you know she wouldn’t even let us look at it?  
Yeah, listen. You know the Canadians. Yves et cetera?
Uh-huh, what, the pension-fund guys?
Yeah. What do they think of me, Frank?
How do you mean, what’s the context?
I can’t give you context.
Okay. Well that’s very interesting context?
Look. As a pal. If there was a situation where a private equity was trying to buy out a – ‘major media company’ – and install a new CEO, how would they view me?
Are you serious? Fuck. So what they’re co-investors?
You know those guys. Behind closed doors are they of the opinion I’m – the real deal, or – in training?
And would there be room to wet the beak of an old pal, in such a situation, Ken?
Frank. Too soon. Get your hard-on out of my soup. I need an answer?
Well. I think they have a lot of time for you. But there may be certain questions.
Oh shit, really?
Look. They think they’re hotshots. They make hard jokes.
I need details.
Well, sometimes when you were absent they used to refer to you as ‘the calamari cock ring’. I don’t know what it even—
Well I think it means they think of me as a cock ring made from calamari, Frank. It’s pretty self-explanatory. Jesus Christ.
I never laughed. I used to give them a very – cool look.
Thanks a lot. Hero.
I guess, I would say, does it really matter? It’s just a satellite launch—
Well, yes. Yes it fucking does, it’s kind of the whole fucking thing for me. Hey? Hey. Tabs? Tabitha? No don’t – don’t. I was sharp. Don’t go.
Why not? Why shouldn’t I?
Because. Because – you’re great for me.
Uh-huh. Well that’s great, for you.
I’m sorry, okay? It’s just it’s not a rocket. It’s a flag.
It is?
It’s a trumpet. It’s a huge fiery trumpet.
You’re a huge fucking trumpet.
I was gonna meme-jack it to announce a personal rebrand. But now everything’s fucked. Forever.
Uh-huh. And me? Am I part of the rebrand, Rome? Is that why I’m here after just four dates?
Yes, Tabs. You’ve been selected as the new face of Roman Roy. You now have to wear the approved fragrance of Roman Roy. And the new range of clothes. No, you fuckhead, you’re here because I like you.
So, what are we going to say?
Well I thought we were going to say illness?
I don’t want to say illness. It plays weak. No.
Okay. Well we can say – busy?
What sort of prick is too busy to go to his daughter’s wedding?
Or we – float that Gil’s campaign is kind of like a cult in some ways, ‘what is this grieving senator’s hold over young Shiv Roy?’ kind of thing.
Makes her look weak. Which makes me look weak. None of my kids have gone round the bend or topped themselves – I might have had my moments but—
No, we’ve always pushed that you’re a good dad.
Because—
Because you are a good dad.
Huh.
So I mean if you don’t want to say illness or work or rift I mean, do we just—
Fuck it. There’s no way out.
I mean if you want to go?
I don’t want to go. There’s no other fucking way out. Karolina – tell Marcia to call Tom and tell him we’re coming. Alright?
Well we can do whatever you want us to do. I’m sorry if we did the wrong thing. He just told us he was coming?
Who’s coming?
Dad. And Marcia.
Dad’s coming now? Here? Do you want him to?
No, I don’t want him to. He never apologized. But Marcia called Tom —
And obviously I said I’d have to ask Shiv—
Meanwhile Marcia called Charlotte and said they were on the jet.
Dad’s coming? Is it about the launch? Is he concerned?
Yeah I’m sure he’s thinking about that twenty-four-seven. What you going to do? You can just say no?
I don’t know? Maybe I have security – just fucking stop him?
No sure. Could do. I just wonder – little bit, could cause a certain atmosphere? I mean I guess he did pay, not that—
If he’s got the balls to walk in, what do we do? Set the dogs on him? No seat, let him stand?
So I hear he’s coming now? That’s wonderful.
Mom, c’mon?
It’s fine. I just hope you won’t forget about me once your father arrives with his Head of Middle Eastern Operations.
Marcia?
Yes. Marcia. Do you still find her a bit—? You know?
We actually became quite close. During Dad’s illness.
What a sweet little scene that must have been. Very moving, I’m sure.
Delicious!
Well I’m glad you like it.
Because it cost a pretty penny.
So, have you got any protein, for us to use?
Protein. I’m not a fucking hen to lay you eggs? I’m a strategist.
I know. But, look. Gil would like a word?
Listen, I don’t want to be overly dramatic, but I was assured when I accepted he wouldn’t be here?
Plans changed. I was ambushed. I’m sorry.
This is not okay from my POV, Siobhan. This compromises me.
I mean you were very eager that Gil—
Well I didn’t realize it was such a chore?
He’s just weighty, Shiv. He carries his gravity. He’s not a man, he’s a fucking planet.
Look, there’s no press. No pictures. We have jammers and a fucking, hawk to take out drones. It’ll be like it never happened?
I hear you might have something explosive I can use?
Maybe. I think so. Just not yet.
Let’s destroy ATN, Shiv. Wouldn’t that be a nice wedding gift to the American people?
Yeah, sure, I’m just concerned. About collateral damage – Tom?
He’ll be fine.
Says the man who has no idea what he’s even talking about.
Shiv. C’mon. I have all the arguments on monopolies in news and the coarsening of our public sphere but I can kind of feel myself falling asleep as I talk. Give me something salty, Shiv. Give me a stick of fucking dynamite to shove up your dad’s ass.
Hey! How you going, man?! Too long. Still trying to teach the world to sing in perfect fucking harmony.
I guess. You know Gil of course?
Pleased to meet you, Mr Eavis.
Likewise. How are you finding it outside the Evil Empire?
Oh fine. I’m fine thank you. And how d’you like it here in the lion’s den?
Oh I’ve been to zoos before.
You like drinking our champagne?
I’m a ‘champagne for all’ guy, not a ‘gruel for all’ guy.
Hey. You know Gil Eavis, sword of the dispossessed and lover of vintage champagne?
I guess technically I should take a swing at you?
And technically I should call you libelous scum.
So, you gonna calm your shit-talk down, or do we have to ramp up?
Well is your dad gonna stop poisoning the discourse of our great republic?
You got a laptop? You seen the shit out there? We’re the fucking good guys now.
Uh-huh?
Join in, bro, by the way, feel free. Shiv? Your guy here is shit-talking our company.
Oh we don’t talk about that, it would be a conflict of interest.
Uh-huh. Nice. Very nice. —
Hey, congratulations, man! Good to finally meet you.
Right. Tom Wambsgans.
Obviously. Nate. Nate Sofrelli?
Uh-huh? Right?
So. What can I say? The best man won!
Right. I’m sorry, as in?
You won the Shiv-off, pal, good luck!
Right and who are you again?
Nate Sofrelli? Did she never? Is this embarrassing?
Oh, right. You’re a pal of Kendall’s?
Yeah. And back in ancient history me and Shiv? We were—?
Right! Okay. Yes. Maybe she did? Right. ‘The best man won!’
Hahah, ‘maybe!’
Aren’t you married?
Getting married. She couldn’t make it. Sends her love.
Just wanted to say hi and thank you, for having me. Tabitha.
Great to meet you, I’ve heard so little about you!
This is amazing. And this is your mom’s place—?
Oh no. No I think – it was her uncle’s, her great-uncle’s, or— The story gets mangled. There was an uncle, who ended up living in Gibraltar with a monkey, and I don’t know. He swindled my mom’s grandpa or. I don’t know. My mom— We’d always come and stay with her nearby. She lives near, to keep the wound fresh, you know?
Uh-huh. It’s good to keep the wounds fresh right?
Right. So what do you do? Who  ?
Oh I’m nobody. Don’t worry about me.
Yeah?
I’m an MBA and I cashed out on my little operation and now I don’t need to work but I’m a corporate coach?
Okay well, I’m going to split because I can see my husband-to-be talking to my ex and it’s making feel like I’m going to hurl, good?
Just to say, it’s so kind of your parents to have paid for this delicious wine, Tom.
Not at all, they wanted to make a contribution.
And it’s so clever the way they’re letting every single person know.
Oh, good?
Okay?
I think I just got stabbed by your mom, but I’m not completely sure?
Uh-huh. That’s how it works. You’ll bleed out in about an hour.
Yeah. I just wanted to get you up here to ask – to ask. About – the table plans and – and—
And have you thought any more about if you want to tell me about the secret thing which—?
Um, and also. Just to say, I did meet ‘Nate’?
You met Nate before I think?
Nope. No.
No? Okay. Well, he’s a good colleague and Kendall and him ran around in Shanghai. And he’s a dick. I mean he’s okay. But he has a certain dickish quality as well. I told you about him?
Uh-huh. Look, Shiv. Is this real?
What do you mean?
Am I a total jerk? Do you really want to do this? Because we don’t have to?
All the people are here, Tom.
Yeah?
And plus I do, I do want to.
Is this— What level are we on? Are you fucking around on me?
Tom?
Honestly? Gil? Gil is charismatic. And this ‘Nate’? I just feel – there are vibes?
As soon as two colleagues are close, Tom? DC loves gossip.
No, sure. But sometimes there are rumors and people aren’t fucking. And – sometimes – they totally are? I just – I don’t know. There are a lot of layers. And we have our plans and I love you and I think you – need me, but right now … I mean, I can cope with almost anything, but I do need to know where the – bottom of the ocean is? So will you tell me, if I am going nuts and what’s real here?
Honestly? This is real. I’m not fucking around.
Well, I trust you.
Good. Thank you.
And that – puts my mind at rest.
You’re a good guy. When I met you I was I was a fucking mess. I need you.
And listen. If you want to know about the cruise-line stuff, the secret stuff. I’ll tell you. Because I think we have to be able to trust, right?
Tom, that would be great.
Hey?
Hey! Hey. When you get in? Where are the kids?
Yeah good. They’re jet-lagged. The happy couple okay?
Oh you know, maintaining the veneer.
And you okay? Maintaining the veneer?
I’m great, actually.
Fine. I just wondered— You look—
I’m fantastic. I did like a hundred and twenty push-ups this morning, so, yeah, I think I’m, okay?
Oh, well if you did a hundred and twenty push-ups?
Rava, I just have a lot going on right now.
Not one of your relaxing interludes?
Yeah I’m a big fucking stress knot, what can I tell you? Probably got a tumor eating me inside out. You want another drink?
Okay, so, I don’t want to talk shop but your lawyers have gone a little quiet, is it just natural or—
I don’t know about that.
Well could you give them a nudge?
Sure.
Great. And look, Ken. I – I know you, okay? I know you and if you want to talk—
I’m good. Yeah the truth is my lawyers are stonewalling because your lawyers are trying to fuck me over. So shall we leave it to them and then you and me can just smile, and, you know, you can do your coy little smile and we can flirt and everything because I love all that shit?
Have a fucking line if you want one that badly, Kendall.
Oh fuck you, everything isn’t what you think? You know? You can’t see inside me just because I’ve told you the occasional fucking thing. Hey hey hey, so what the fuck’s going on here? This looks mighty fucking cozy?
Hey, Ken, we were just – we were just saying, I came to here when you were all kids the first time, like ’83 maybe?
Uh-huh? Yeah? Right. Great. Sorry. I’m sorry. I should circulate.
I’m happy to tell. But do we have to do it tonight? It’s not very weddingy? Because it’s about corporate cover-up of crimes and institutionalized sexual abuse.
Uh-huh. Same old same old.
And that’s not very, ‘something borrowed, something blue’?
Still?
Okay well, there were, pay-offs, legal and semi-illegal intimidation.
And have you personally got plausible deniability?
I think. Digital deep-clean. And I got the paper material shredded. Outside team. Inside, to sign the material out, Greg.
Greg?
Greg. Yeah family seemed safest. But Greg’s expendable.
What – you’d – kill – Greg?
No! But we could, we can shut him up right? Family?
Right.
And what are you going to do with it? Because if I give you the details, it could hurt me, Shiv.
You’re a good guy.
I’m not a good guy. I’m not. But I do love you.
And I love you.
And you won’t let me get hurt?
Kendall – could you spare a cheeky ciggy?
Hey, Mom.
So. How are you?
I’m good.
Yes?
Yeah. I think. You know. Whatever it means.
I was sorry to hear how everything went with the – board thing.
Roman. I never could rely on him.
No.
So, how are you, Mom?
Oh you know.
Not really no. No. It’s quite hard, to know.
Oh well.
I don’t know if this is any use to you, but so you know. I used to see someone, to talk to, and I’ve forgiven you.
Oh, thank you. What for?
What for? For – well for – leaving us and – for – for—
For having a little bit of fun? Do you think he ever did a single thing he didn’t want to do? Ever?
Hey!
C’mon. Forbidden fruit.
Nate.
Has the chicken laid the egg?
Um, nope. Not yet, no joy.
Look at you. I’m desperate to make you concentrate on nothing but me for just fifteen minutes.
You think I used to concentrate on you? not
So, Greg-Egg, how long do you give it?
I’m sorry?
The marriage. How long do you give it?
Oh. Is there – doubt afoot?
I mean   for one think they look solid as a rock!
Hey.
Hello.
Hello, Siobhan.
So. I’m ‘feeling much better’.
He’s much improved.
Great. You weren’t actually invited though? Maybe I’ll see if they can make you an omelette or something? Find you a chair?
I think usually the ones who are paying, get a chair, no?
Oh I didn’t realize   contributed, Marcia, I’m so rude. Thank you.
Logan. Lovely to see you, as always. It’s wonderful you made it in the end.
We wouldn’t have missed it.
Well you nearly did. But well done you! Are you feeling   better?
We were sorry not to be here to help. Has it been very busy? You look tired?
Oh don’t worry I haven’t been making canapés. But I am seeing a new guy. Perhaps it’s taking a toll?
So they gave this place a lick of paint?
I believe it’s very popular with footballers and Russians. You probably know them all, Marcia. Excuse me, I should circulate!
How’s the big man? All good?
All very good. Everything’s good acquisition-wise. Just need to shut down the voice of the fucking people over there. Kendall.
Hey, Dad.
So, what about it, son, shall we jump out of the trenches for a game of soccer? Can I bring you some corn to get you through the winter? So, how you doing? What’s the news?
Oh, keeping busy.
Need a reference for your resume?
I’m good.
‘Relatively punctual’. ‘Prone to occasional bouts of insubordination’.
Yeah well. You know.
So how long you gonna fuck about on the outside?
Uh-huh. You recruiting? What, a new Head of Being Continually Thwarted?
How would a TV network suit you? One of the big guys? When I land it? Could that work?
You feeling the heat on your own? Want me back? Like to put that in a press release?
No I’m just a lovely guy.
Uh-huh. Well, thanks, Dad.
Okay, what was all that, cocksucker?
Oh he was just telling me how shitty you are at doing your job.
Fuck you. Did he mention the launch? He knows I’ve accelerated? —
Hello. Caroline Collingwood, mother of the bride. How long do you give it?
Oh I’d say, I don’t know. Forever. Or until Shiv goes away for a week. Whichever comes first.
You beast!
Um, Mom?
Yes?
Mom, I hear you’re asking people, ‘How long do you give it?’
It’s a cheeky icebreaker.
Yeah. Sure. But it’s kind of horrible?
It’s not all about you, Shiv. Other people need something to say.
Well could you ask them about the price of fucking fish instead?
I like your girlfriend, Roman.
Well thank you. I met her at a sex party where she was giving the groom a blowjob.
Hahahhah. You should marry that one.
Excuse me?
And, Shiv. Stop taking everything so seriously! I am trying to sparkle. When people ask me how long I give it, I say forever! And it will be forever.
Uh-huh. Thank you.
Or it’ll feel like forever.
She says she’s being impish.
She’s being a stone-cold bitch. Listen. Last meet, tonight, if you want? In The Place? I need to catch Dad.
So what was the white whale saying to you?
Oh nothing. Think he’s shoring up his position. It’s not real. He’s under pressure.
You good? No wobbles? You’re okay?
Yes I’m okay! I’m not going to get cold-cocked here am I, Stewy? I heard from Frank the Canadians might not be too keen on me?
You talked to the fucking grandfather clock? Has he signed anything?
Frank? That would be rude. He – he taught me to fly in his Cessna.
‘Your honor, in lieu of a non-disclosure agreement we have this faded Polaroid of some conspicuous consumption.’ C’mon, man! You’re not a little prince anymore, don’t rely on Sir Talky of Fuckchester? Okay?
He’s good, Stewy.
Look. Can we do a catch-up in the war room in five?
Ah, Mr Fuckhead, I presume.
Logan Roy.
So. Are we allowed to talk?
Well I’ve nothing but admiration for you personally, Mr Roy.
Oh really?
Well. It’s the sort of thing you say, isn’t it?
Classy. Look, what have you got against me?
You’re the one making it personal. I’m just trying to do my job. Think about everyone, not just myself—
The interest of each is the good of all. That, is the whole of the law.
You don’t need to remind me of my Adam Smith, I taught economics.
Uh-huh, kindergarten was it?
What about from each according to his ability to each according to his need?
Sure. But what about – and this isn’t me talking, but what about me, Mr Fucking Ability, busting my chops in my auto shop just so some needy fuck in the projects can jack off on my time? That’s the issue, I’m afraid.
When you’re a crook, you can’t imagine anyone else is decent.
I didn’t make human nature. But I do know what they watch and what they read. I make my nut off of what people really want, so don’t tell me about people. I’d go flat bust in a week if I didn’t.
Keep singing the song, Logan. I’m digging. I’m joining the dots and digging you out.
Hey! Good to see you, Logan, glad you made it.
Uh-huh.
And just to say. New Mexico. Things get said. You know. And – no hard feelings.
Right. Huh. Thanks.
Well. Apology accepted!
Sleep well, Dad. Marcia.
Thank you.
Could be your last good one for a decade or two?
Huh?
The cruise situation?
I don’t know what you’re talking about.
Uh-huh. Sure. Well, you might be about to find out? Unless?
You could afford to be a little more amenable, Siobhan. He came.
You don’t know, Marcia. Okay?
I know plenty.
Maybe, maybe you do.
I know when I see a spoiled slut.
Excuse me?

Who   you? Apart from a, a fucking, machine for, accumulating power and keeping yourself – safe.
You have no idea how vulnerable a human being can be.
Never to do a single thing for its own sake. Have you ever had a fucking – grapefruit – without an agenda?
He made you a playground and you think it’s the whole world. Well ! Fuck off, go on, out, see how you like it!
Oh you two you seem like very good— It’s okay. It’s okay, Siobhan.
Someone will be in touch.
You know, you’re fucking great.
Well thank you.
You’re not a headfuck, or a bitch or a leech.
You say such pretty things.
Seriously. You’re a unicorn. You came over here. I mean how long have we known each other? And you haven’t got your meat hooks in at all, you never once asked to stay over or how it works with my dad or the trust or what my stake is, you know?
I’m just pathologically incurious.
I tell you what, Tabs, I’m like stepping up, grown-up shit.
One thing about grown-ups? They tend not to walk around saying ‘I’m a grown-up.’
What if I was prepared to marry you?
Hello?
Shiv’s getting married, Kendall got married.
What if you came down from Olympus and proposed to a mere mortal? No. This is crazy.
Why?
Because this isn’t a normal relationship.
Why?
Why? Well, one, because we never fuck.
Yeah we do.
Well, no we don’t.
Oh come on. We do! We’ve been busy.
You – kind of – jerked off –   me.
Well there’s no need to be disgusting.
Look, Rome, honestly, I’ve had more sexual contact with the groom than you?
Tabs, please, I’ve asked you not to talk about—
I’ve slept with a lot of guys, Roman. If that’s a problem you better say.
No. No. It’s just – Tom. Look, I can’t get into all this. Do you want to get married or not?
Is this how you think you get someone to stay? Is it some sort of tax scam? I mean why the fuck would I marry you?
Hey hey. Gerri. Thanks for—
Uh-huh, what is this?
Just a chat?
Right, it’s your wedding, why do I feel like I’m going to get fucked?
Okay, look, it’s late, so. Here’s the situation. I know all about the cruise-division horror show. And the cover-up. And Gil wants to go to town on you. But maybe I can stop him. If ATN lays off the personal stuff. Gil’s wife.
You want us to stop attacking him? ‘Poor lickle fwagile presidential candidate’?
No. Keep attacking him through the primaries. Fire up our base. Then back off for the general. But no more wife stuff.
They’re journalists, Shiv, not remote-control little—
Sure they are. I just feel confident a little public comment or two from my dad. An email. The minions realign pretty quick?
Uh-huh. And you’re – just to be clear – you’re – you’re—
Yes, I’m bullying. I’m blackmailing you. I’m threatening to destroy my father. However you want to put it.
And you’re happy with that?
Oh come on. It is what it is.
Uh-huh. You used to be such a nice girl.
And Tom needs to be clean, move him on. Move him up. Maybe abroad. Clean hands.
You’re very pushy, missy.
Thank you, fairy godmother.
And if I was authorized to accept can you get Mr Smith to fuck off back to Washington and not pull down his pants to show off his amazing morals?
I think I can persuade him that a dirty LBJ gets more done than a clean McGovern. Okay. Goodnight. No marriage advice from my dear old godmother?
Don’t ask me – my husband died. Don’t let him die?
Um, Stew – what is this? I was talking?
I’m sorry, dude. Jess, would you?
No. Stew. Seriously. My wife, my kids – I need to—
Stop. Ken – I’ve got Sandy on the line.
You’ve what?
Sandy? Sandy?
What is it?
He can say.
You can say, Stew.
Hello, Sandy? Can you hold for Mr Furness?
He was just there, where’d he go?
What the fuck? You’re not going to say? Is this the cold-cock?
I think it’s best for him to say.
You’re such a pussy. Is this – is this Canadian shit? Because I’m the only person who can do this, Stew, you know that.
It’s about the bear-hug letter. He can explain.
What? C’mon, man!
An acceleration.
Oh no, fuck off. What?
This weekend. Hello, Sandy?
At my sister’s wedding. Are you insane? What do you want this to be –  ?
Hello?
Hi. Yeah he told me already. No. Absolutely not. No way. No fuck this.
Hey, Kendall. I’m sorry. Listen. But you told Frank.
I hinted—
We’ve been contacted by a reporter, they know something’s cooking. We have to go now or risk a leak which kills us.
We’re all together, this isn’t a good time.
Well it really is a good time. Your dad’s out of the loop? In the UK. We catch him off guard.
No. I need to prepare. Sandy? That’s just human. You know, I need to, I need prep time, for the approach?
You can’t practice needing a shit.
But we’ll be stuck here with him?
I’m afraid you’re going to have to suck it up.
Uh-huh. Seriously?
You can’t make an omelette without breaking some arms. I’m sorry, okay? We’ll be in touch with the letter, and let’s close- coordinate on the minute it’s presented? Okay? Thanks, kid.
Motherfucker. I oughta go. I gotta go.
Hey.

Hey!
Where’s Con?
Con? Was he invited?
I thought you were going to tell him?
Oh, man! What?
Do you want me to get him? I told Willa?
Well, I mean, What is this?
It’s nothing. I just thought it would be nice. But I don’t— Um? I have things to do. You know?
I thought this was for old times’.
Likewise. Kinda lot cooking?
Oh c’mon. I’m gonna be stoned out of my gourd!
One hit.
To old times.
So. Listen. Guys. Look. I’ve got something I need to tell you. I went to Mom’s. And she got me to sort through some of her old papers. And – Shiv, you’re adopted. And Kendall you’re adopted. And Connor’s adopted. So I think that means everything comes to me and you can all fuck off?
Yeah. I’m sorry. I don’t know why I got you down here.
No, it’s nice. Congratulations.
It is what it is.
It’s nice. Tom’s okay.
He doesn’t know what he’s saying he’s so fucking high.
Listen. Can I suggest a hug?
Are you serious?
What is this?
Fine fuck you.
Fuck you, come on then.
No way. That is so gay.
Roman?
Come on, you know you want to, bitch.
Okay come on, bring it in.
Here we all are, happy as can be, all good friends and jolly good company.
If either of you try to fuck me, I will hit you.
You know we’ve been dicked over, right? By them. But it’s alright. It’s all alright.
Oh sure.
There’s the games and there’s this – and the games don’t affect this, right?
That’s big.
What?
Seriously. That’s big of you. It must hurt, being outside, seeing me do big shit? Winning the game.
Yeah, well.
I hope you’re okay outside, man.
I like your date.
Yeah and she seems to loathe me, which I obviously find incredibly appealing.
Does she remind you a little of Mom?
I’ve never done crack. But I guess Mom is like how I imagine crack?
Um—
If crack didn’t get you high. You’re jonesing. Then you get a hit. And …   come-down.
‘Family’s a drug with no high.’
Side effects may include: diarrhea, nausea, shortness of breath, anal seepage, sexual dysfunction, blindness and death.
Hey?! Guys? Ken? Hello?
Con. Where you been, man?
I went to the other place – is this, was this The Place? I thought—
This was the place we came. We always came here.
Right. I guess – I guess, maybe I just didn’t come so much?
We’re turning in, bud.
Tom is my friend, but is he my real friend? I mean I think I owe him this. But do I? I mean I don’t want to say. But what if he finds out I knew? I mean, do I owe it to him to tell him? Or do I owe it to him to totally not tell him?
I think tell him.
Yeah?
Or maybe don’t. I don’t fucking know. —
You know I was quite outraged when she suggested this.
I don’t like being outside the US for too long.
It doesn’t sit well.
There’s a mercilessness I miss.
I don’t like squalid little deals.
Fucking without a rubber. Everywhere else feels soft. Look at this fucking place.
Yeah well. It’s all very refined.
Refined. Ha! That? All of it. Slaves, cotton and sugar. This country was nothing but an off-shore factory for turning evil into hard currency.
Is this where you tell me you’re working for the communists?
Ha! Now it fucking lies here, living off the capital, sucking in immigrants to turn it and stop it from getting bedsores.
I was looking forward to taking you down. You’ve got a very persuasive daughter.
Oh, but doesn’t a deal feel so much better?
Handshake?
I don’t think either of us want to get dirty, do we?
Hey, morning, Greg! How’s the shabbiest groomsman in town!
Urgh? Fine. Good. Good thanks, Tom.
You okay, kiddo? Need someone to let out your dress?
Uh-huh.
You okay?
Sure. Just. You know.
Good. Good man. Good to have you here, kiddo. Good to have you here, you know I rough-house you but I know it’s because you can take it. You’re a good kid. You’re okay.
Look, Tom, I’ve been up all night and I didn’t know how to tell you this …
Is it about ‘our secret thing’?
Nope. No, it’s – it’s, I don’t know, Tom. I just— It doesn’t feel right not to say, but it’s a huge deal saying so— I’ve been wrestling and – basically, I’m pretty sure Shiv is like—
No, Greg.
I think she’s having an affair.
No. You’re wrong.
Well no because—
Shut up, Greg.
Maybe I’m wrong?
Yes you are wrong, so that’s all good.
Oh, well. Right?",0.4078908130426758,0.595118524240596,0.2821948027620757,0.3532181591061609,0.3536084509853806,0.3244397031542446,0.33583634226982084,0.33366636165893787,0.4215510493210916,0.30923285774354425,0.16804213083482214,0.12067800459460289,0.1771598631582622,0.5237880405703825,0.42643064588108764,0.2188194855448923,0.25498834846907165,0.23464403052847566,0.10641589985191656
10,"Yes. So. Thank you for your time.
You don’t want to hear …?
I don’t need to hear, Greg, because it was a misunderstanding.
I don’t think it was, dude.
Stop saying it.
But …
Shut up!
Hey. I’m just trying to—
Fucking shut up.
I feel sorry for you, man.
Shut up.
Dude, I’m not making it up.
Shut up, Greg. Shut up shut up shut up.
Why are you hitting me, Tom? I’m the only one that likes you?
I’m sorry, Greg!
Wanna game it?
Deliver. He calls emergency board. We release the letter. The world blows up. The arbs dive in. He tells the world some fairy tales. Talks poison pills, other defenses. Board says, ‘Hold on, we don’t want to get sued.’ Dad says, ‘Fuck the shareholders.’ Calls analysts, calls us, tells us to fuck off. The price rockets – because everyone knows we’re going to win.
You think there’s any chance he’ll just do a deal?
Nope. He’ll never retreat. It’ll be hostile hostile hostile.
There he blows! The fucking brontosaurus. Always wants to fuck but can never get hard.
Yeah yeah.
What? Good to demonize the enemy before you have to kill him, man.
And the siblings and partners?
Just to say, I want Willa in this.
Um, okay? I’m not sure …
I’m not sure if that’s appropriate?
Oh no, that’s fine, it is appropriate.
Is it appropriate? Or could it be problematic?
No it won’t be problematic.
Um?
Connor, she’s been a call girl and one day that might come out and it could hurt my profile, or Tom’s profile, so I don’t want to be horrible but, you get it, okay?
Okay. I get it, but, if you don’t allow it I’m going to punch Tom in the face and rip my shirt open and take a fucking dump on the ground here and go apeshit because she’s the woman I love. You get it?
Um, dude, I’d like Tabs in this one, okay?
Oh really?
Uh-huh. Yes. I’m pretty into her. And it might be nice.
Okay. It’s just—
It’s just what, Tom?
I— We – obviously, shared a moment She sucked me off, so? No, no. I mean. No. Fine. Sure. It’s all good.
Thank you.
Okay?
Uh-huh. They think it’s just a hobbyist but they’re doing a sweep for paps.
Good because, Gil, will be – eager, to keep things discreet.
We’ll take care of it.
If you find anyone? Don’t be too gentle. Few bruises. Something broken, something blue, yeah?
Hey!
Hey.
So? That it?
Uh-huh. I just added we’re not subject to any financing conditions?
Okay, yeah print, three of these.
And so, now, I guess – the only question is like – who actually – you know – delivers it to him?
Are you serious?
Well – yeah we can’t just send him a fucking Domino’s with this as an extra topping. We have to be certain he’s had eyes on it—
I know but I assumed – you?
Oh. Right, I assumed you?
Fine. I just guess, if like we were planning to fuck your dad to death, to make our fortune, I might offer – to actually do the fucking?
Are you scared?
Fuck you. No. Are you?
Yes. I am scared. Little bit. So if I’m scared and you’re not scared, I guess, you should do it?
Seriously?
We could ask, Jess to?
Fine. Fuck it – I can cope. Okay. Are we ready or what?
Sorry, it should be printing.
But it’s not?
Oh – shit.
What?
I think it’s connected to a, a different printer – on their Wi-Fi network.
Are you fucking serious?
Where is it, Jess?
I don’t know. It doesn’t say.
Oh Jesus! You need to find it, Jess. Now! Hey what the fuck!! No! Hello?! Hello? Oh. Hey. Hey how are you going, kiddo? Sorry. Sorry, son.
Sorry? Mom said we could come?
Sorry, son. Sorry. One minute.
Hey, I’m sorry, kiddo.
They thought you could show them the place? But— Are you okay?
Sure. Yes. I’m sorry, Iver.
Okay. It’s like five in the afternoon, Ken? You okay?
I’m great. I’m good. Just – some big moves.
Sure. Well, see you later.
Okay. Okay. Listen – I’ll see you later. Okay?
Okay. Jess thinks she has it. But you should go, in case. You good? We doing this?
Yeah I’m doing this. You’ll email Gerri and the board?
Just tell me when it’s delivered.
You don’t think I can deliver it?
No. I know. It’s just. You know, only fifteen percent of men, when it comes to it, actually shoot an undefended enemy soldier. There’s an instinct not to kill.
I’m good.
Would it be possible to make an exception at all? I really need my phone? I’m the godmother and senior legal counsel, I’ll be fucking keeping it, goodbye.
No. Phallocentric bullshit. I don’t want a big fucking – dick blasting off at my wedding, okay?
It’s not a big dick, Shiv, okay? It’s not the fault of rockets or dicks, that they   to be aerodynamic in shape, okay?
Hello?
Hey. Is my father available?
What is it?
It’s— I just need to have a word.
Logan! It’s Kendall.
Tell him if he wants to stop me buying papers and stations, he can fuck off, we’re good to go. Come through, son!
Do you want to, come out, Dad?
Come in. I’m not on the can. Nice service right? Shame it wasn’t Catholic but there you go. Fucking all those kids will hurt the brand.
Hey. This isn’t a nice thing, I’m afraid.
Hello?
Um. Yeah. Read this.
What is it?
It’s – it’s – a proposal, to buy Waystar for a hundred and forty dollars a share. We’re asking you to come to the table – open the books.
Ugh?
It’s great value for shareholders.
Huh?
Yeah. There it is, I’m not going to get into feelings.
It’s— This is – a – fucking bear hug?
That’s right.
Guh.
Well, fine. We have the financing. Let’s see what everyone thinks. Let’s keep it professional. You know, it’s just the situation that has arisen and you’re very tough and so am I, as your son, so, I think this is just the way it has to be with us. We know several major investors are in favor. We go public with the letter tomorrow. So then we’ll have to see – to see – what the arbs make of it?
Who?
It’s me and Stewy. And Sandy. He’s some of the cash so. I’m not sorry for what I’m doing which is – correct, but I am sorry for how it makes you feel. I’m sorry it had to be now. It was out of my hands. External factors. Here.
No. Fuck off. I haven’t got pants on! Do you even know what you’re doing this for?
I— Ideas. I have – wanted to do things.
Uh-huh?
To save the business and and and do – do things that are—
You can’t even fucking say it.
I can say it. Do, some, good, things.
‘Do good things.’ Be a fucking nurse.
Look at my little prince!
Hey.
Hey. —
Marcia!
Gerri! Where’s Gerri? Karl.
Karl’s in New York, Logan, what is it? Get out of there!
I need Gerri, I need Karl. I need—
What is it?
Bear hug, then they’ll go— It’ll— A – hostile. It makes sense. It fits.
Today?
I don’t know. I don’t fucking know. It’s not a good position I am in. If he has financing, and major shareholders? And – I’m here. By tomorrow? I need – I need a lot of things I don’t have—
You’re alright. It’s okay, Logan. Take a breath. Amir!
And I’m tired. I’m tired.
Logan. Amir, in here now please!
Hey. Senator Eavis, Connor Roy! Huge skeptic. Massive skeptic.
Good to know.
Big problems with you and everything you stand for, my friend! —
You okay?
I look at you and I see Weimar. Hyper-inflation. I look at your face and, no offense, but I see dead babies.
Con?
Very interesting. I’d have to disagree. Would you excuse me?
Of course. Great to joust a little! That’s the best he can do?
He’s going to be president, Con.
Really? But I just wiped the floor with him in a debate?
Is it him? You don’t want a rocket launch cos of him? Would it help if it was a rocket full of – Muslim – granola?
Roman. It would just be fucking weird. Don’t be a little kid.
‘Oh I’m so adult and important because I work for a man with glasses.’ Is he a Jew by the way?
Oh come on, man.
What? It’s just a simple, friendly, slightly racist question. You used to be fun. When did you become one of them, Shiv?
One of who?
The fucking dancey bullshit people.
Yeah well sorry if I don’t want to come to your freewheelin’, good- time, n-word-shouting hoedown.
The n-word, the b-word, the c-word. The world isn’t a fucking nursery school. And people don’t like being taught.
Wait, have you been watching our channels? I thought you knew not to do that, with your IQ?
Excuse me. I actually have to go watch a satellite launch in Japan that I’m actually in charge of? That I reorganized for you. But you’re too fucking carbon neutral to enjoy.
Fine. Go on! Fuck off.
Okay. Good. It’s streaming. It’s good. It’s good. I got it. Wish everyone luck yeah? In Japanese obviously.
So. What happened? Tell me what the fuck happened?
I did it.
You did it? Fuck. Okay. What did he do?
He threw it in the toilet.
He threw it in the toilet?
That’s a detail for our next letter to shareholders right?
Look at you, you stone-cold killer fuck!
It was horrible. It was pretty fucking horrible, Stew.
Yeah. I couldn’t— My dad? I couldn’t imagine. Hey – shall we – Jess? Will you give us a moment? Celebrate?
So, Willa. Listen. I think I might have found a job I want to do.
Okay? What is it?
President of the United States.
Okay. Wow.
Yeah? You don’t look excited?
Sure. It would be a fun project.
Is this the play?
No.
Because I loved it.
Sure. You just don’t want to waste your money putting it on? But running for president, that’s a sound investment?
Plus I’d be planning to spend on you know, making sure your ‘history’ was, cleaned up? The president, Willa. That’s big.
Sure. But there’s nothing more powerful than art?
No, sure. Apart from the power of the Executive Branch.
Drama can change minds.
Sure but, I’d control the Federal Reserve?
Roman. Meet Denis Linton.
Ugh huh?
Denis is police and – what – commissioner? He knew your father and me back when he did something even more boring, right, Denis?
Uh-huh, thanks for looking after us!
Hey so how was it – the launch?
I’m sorry? What?
How did it go?
Roman’s been coordinating a satellite launch? How did it go?
Oh, great. It went great.
Okay, well, great! Congratulations, Rome!
Thank you! It’s exciting!
Cancel everything else. I fly out— Find out if I can leave now.
Now?
Options. Now. In three hours, in— Are my pilots on the clock— Check who’s got the hours to fly me home, or scheduled.
You don’t want to look panicked?
Huh. Tomorrow maybe. Gerri? What’s the— Where are you on that—
Um, emergency phone board meeting for later, tonight? Or is that tomorrow?
Tomorrow.
They’re going to have deeper pockets, better prep.
Find out where that fucking shrunken Californian raisin is.
The president? I think that’s smart.
Come on – come on! The financials are hard. We need political support. Let’s get down there. Come on, let’s get going!
Look at you.
Logan, for tonight, shall we—?
Oh for tonight? For tonight?
Can I top you up?
Nuh. What the fuck! Jerk.
I’m sorry I didn’t mean to—
Yeah well you did. Fucking prick. Do as you’re told. Go on – get out of here.
I thought he said yes but he said … I’m sorry I thought you …
Stop mumbling. Don’t look at me. Fuck off. Where do you get these people, they’re fucking amateurs. Get out. I’m soaked through. Get him out I don’t want to see him again. Ever. Okay?
Could you perhaps fetch me a stronger beverage? Hi. Yes? Can I help?
Um. I’m very busy on – another matter. Are you across this? I’ve had forty calls about the launch.
Well that’s weird, because I haven’t had any?
Yeah. It blew up.
It blew up?
Yes it exploded on the launch pad.
Okay. Wow. They should have told me. That’s – naughty. And how bad is it? Is it bad?
Well yeah it is bad.
And are— People are there people who are – from the launch site?
I don’t know. Yes. The scale means there are likely casualties. It’s very unclear.
Does Dad know?
No. Have you spoken to him?
No. Will you tell him?
No, well it’s not a good time so – I guess he’s concentrating on – enjoying Shiv’s wedding day.
Right. So, can they deal? Out there can I— I mean, this is a little detail in my world, Gerri. Not to be horrible?
You were the lead exec, I understood.
I was somewhat aware of the endeavor.
Well, yes they can deal, but we need to be prepared for any comeback. I mean I’m just thinking legally—
Uh-huh. Because I did put on quite a lot of pressure to accelerate the launch even though there were concerns.
You did?
Yes I did.
Oh fuck.
I thought it would be nice. For it to happen on Shiv’s wedding day. Like fireworks? Big fireworks.
Well you got that right.
I’m just telling you because I sent quite a lot of emails and I – you know— There’s no use hiding that because— I mean I’m just going to say, that’s for you as general counsel to know. So you can protect me.
Well I can try. But, fuck. You’re looking at potential corporate manslaughter.
You just sign there.
 … I wouldn’t have missed this for the world. This is a very memorable day. A day I’ll never forget, as long as I live. I wanted it to be perfect. For my daughter. And it is. Nothing could ruin this. It means so much to be surrounded by everyone we love and trust and hold dear. Because nothing is more important than family.
What about we do London, tomorrow?
Uh-huh.
And I’ve put together the list of investor calls. Karl is making initial contact.
And a poison pill? Should you consider?
Yup. I’ll have the options on a poison-pill defense. President in twenty-five. The EU Commissioner in the morning. Yes?
Yeah.
And have you told the others?
The others?
The kids?
No. Is there an advantage?
Well. I don’t— No also, to, to just to tell them? —
So you did it? —
I love my wife. I love saying she’s my wife. I just love the word ‘wife’. Wife, wife, wife, wife, wife, wife, wife. She’s my wife! And she’s my life. And I love her very much. And I’m going to stop talking now because I feel like I’m going to cry and it would be crazy to cry because I’m just so happy. Thank you all for being here. I love you all. —
I believe it’s traditional to invite you to dance?
Hey excuse me. Can I get just two?
Thanks for the text message. What the fuck was that? ‘I won’t do it if you don’t.’ Is that a kind of anti-proposal?
Look I just spoke to Gil and it sounds like, well, he thinks he’s being very subtle and all but something has happened and I wondered what the fuck that was?
What’s happened with what?
In terms of burying whatever it is we know about and not being scared of ATN anymore?
Oh, okay, that’s an interesting change of perspective?
I brought you in, what did I do?
I’m going to make him win.
He’s going to win anyway.
I might not agree.
Well yeah. Look, I don’t want to play the bleeding heart but— there’s a reason I work with him and it’s because— inequality and—
‘Inequality.’ If you can’t handle it, fuck off.
Who are you?
I’m Shiv fucking Roy. And I’m going to have two grateful people: the president and my father.
Okay. I’m sorry, honey. I’m sorry. But you need to talk to your brother. I think you all need to chat.
Um. Kendall? Could I grab a word with you?
Uh-huh? What is it?
Oh just a thing, just a little thing. Would you mind? In private?
I’m – sorry, bro. I didn’t give you the full, full picture.
Oh. Okay. Okay.
So what the fuck? Dad told us. How could you?
It, it was out of my hands, Shiv – I—
You’re a real piece of work, you know that? You act like you’re a fucking – guy, a decent guy, but seriously?
Look – we can talk. There’s no need to talk to me like I’m—
I think we get to talk to you any way we fucking like.
The fact is I was forced into this position against my wishes.
Boo-hoo. Boo-fucking-hoo.
You can talk to me. I’ll answer any questions you have.
Yeah I have a question. What the fuck in the name of all the fuck in the universe do you think you’re doing?
I’m trying to save the company.
By fucking us, forever?
If this works, which undoubtedly it will, you’ll all be very very very rich and maybe it’s for the best for this to no longer be a family operation.
Well no, because for one thing, our inheritance is all in stock so after this, if Dad goes loco – and pisses it all away, nothing.
Kendall, we’re – we’re— This is— Look, I can say it because I don’t even care, but the fact is, right now we’re somebodies, we’re people, any doofus can have a few million bucks!
Oh come on!
This is a unilateral decision. To fundamentally alter the nature of the family, on my wedding day. Do you have any conception of how fucking selfish you are?
This isn’t about a dress.
Fuck off.
He’s right. It’s about the next – one thousand years.
The Thousand-Year Reich? Uh-huh? That will endure for eternity? Dad is fucked? You’re all – fucking – guarding a trash can full of diapers. Wake up. This is – just a little maneuver. You don’t need to get sentimental.
Look, I’m no fucking blushing bride – but the, the lack of thought, I can’t believe it. To do this to Dad, today?
Oh, let’s not pretend, Shiv? This isn’t about Dad. This is because you like the power. It gets you close to the poles you like to grease. And Rome, you couldn’t get a job in a fucking burger joint let alone a Fortune 500 without some nepotism and – Con, you like the glamour it gives to a fucking – freak in the desert.
No. I could actually do with the assistance of the family firm on my ambitions to become president.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Exactly. You’re all living in a fucking dreamworld.
Hello. How’s the torture going?
I ought to go. This is— I shouldn’t even, talk to you.
I don’t think there’s any reason not to, legal or otherwise?
I’m not getting into it.
You don’t think you owe us an explanation?
I don’t owe you anything.
Ha! What have you had your whole life that I didn’t give you?
I don’t—
I blame myself. I spoiled you and now you’re fucked. I’m sorry, you’re a hothouse flower and you’re nothing. You’re curdled cream. Maybe you can write a book or, or collect sports cars – or something but for the world, no I’m sorry, you’re not made for it. You can’t stand it.
You’re a fucking beast.
Hey. Okay? I think Logan came calling to my room. I thought it was safest just to hole up here—
Right. Listen, we got – we got some more?
Uh-huh? Shall we both, just— You know, could be a big day tomorrow?
Sure. You got a little though? In case we want – for tomorrow?
Um? I’m not sure?
You wanna look?
We’re good, right?
We’re good.
Sandy wants a check-in at two and at four and at six GMT. Okay?
Wise. Wise. I could just do with a straightener?
Okay. Well I’m all out. I think. Sorry, but we’re good?
Fine. Okay. Fine. Well, catch you later.
And wow shit, did anyone die?
We don’t know. But it will be fine. And, dude, were you kidding, about the presidential thing?
No. Why?
Because I think it’d be a disaster.
Screw you. No. I think I could do it.
Right. I mean, what would you even – want to do.
Well. I would launch a campaign, against the Great Dangers.
Which are?
Honestly, from my readings, and sadly you cannot say this because the permitted public debate has shrunken to the size of a fucking nut. But, frankly, onanism and usury.
Excuse me, Harry Potter?
This isn’t for public consumption, it’s from my readings.
Cuck-oo.
And I want to not pay tax.
Well, tell me about it.
As a protest. Like Thoreau. He had it right, let me tell you. He had it all right.
Roman, if I leave for New York after the cake is cut will you stay up tonight as linkman?
Did you hear yet?
About?
Japan? How many dead?
Oh yeah, did you not hear? None.
None? None at all?
Two guys lost thumbs and there might be an arm they won’t be able to save. But they might.
Are you kidding? It’s just an arm? A couple of fucking thumbs?
Yeah so sad but—
Are you kidding? Jesus. We’re not going to ruin a party over a couple of fucking thumbs!
And the good news is, we’re in a good insurance position on the satellites.
Okay, see? I’m making us money!
Uh-huh. This will overall probably be revenue neutral.
How we all going? Sorry about ‘everything’.
Hey, Tom, guess who didn’t kill anyone? But only maybe lost a coupla thumbs?
I don’t—
This guy!
Great? Well congratulations.
Tabs. It’s alright, it’s okay, nobody died!
Oh. Okay? That’s nice.
Yeah I kinda always wondered if I was a psychopath but apparently not. I’m actually relieved. We have to celebrate!
Okay, sure! How?
I dunno. Wanna go try to launch my rocket? Eyebrow eyebrow.
Hey.
Hey. So, I heard.
Yeah well.
Right. I just wanted to say – good luck.
Good luck?
Just – you know, the place has got to change I feel.
It has, right?
It just does.
Uh-huh.
All that – the old shit, the nasty politics, the – the stuff at the cruise lines and all that? You know about that? Yeah, cos I helped clean it up, but you know?
So listen, do you know where I can— I wouldn’t mind a— Do you have some, something something?
I wish! But you know. I kept hold of a few little bits and pieces just in case I got into trouble you know? So I would think, I’d think anybody would be wise to keep me in a good role?
I see you.
Some of the guys smoke weed out the back. I think.
I see you, Greg. I like it, you fucking little operator.
Well that was – nice.
Uh-huh.
It was, it was fine.
‘It was fine’? She whispered, exhausted from their lovemaking. What every man longs to hear.
I mean, considering neither of us came, it was – it was an occasionally enjoyable way to pass twenty minutes.
Two stars.
You know, you could do anything, Rome, if this goes down, with your brother.
Yeah?
Yeah. One lousy lay doesn’t mean it’s all over?
The thing is. I   do anything? I have the money? It’s just figuring out what.
What did you major in at college?
I went to college, but I wasn’t really paying attention.
Right?
I just wish I knew everything, about something. One thing, to build on. Then I could just – bang – fuck them all!
Rome, you don’t need to take over the world tomorrow. You need to build up. And get all the way to the edge, and then when you’re right there, you wait for it to happen. And when it does, it feels great.
I like you and the words you say.
So, do you wanna talk about the takeover, and how it affects—
You look amazing.
Because I mean you’re in on merit and if he succeeds I think it will be tough but in terms of—
I don’t care about that.
I mean if Gil takes off I think – well – maybe I don’t even want to go back inside and our five-year plan looks a little different?
Shush. Shiv, let’s just fuck.
I have bad news about my hymen.
Shiv, I wanted to get married to you not for our plan or – because— Look, you’re hard and you’re tough but you know, but I want in, I want in on you. And I don’t care. Let’s go and be sheep farmers in New Zealand!
Sheep farmers?
I mean. You can scuba?
Yes?
Let’s teach scuba! Let’s just get out.
I should say something, Tom. I should have said. But I’ve had a little number?
A little number?
And I think we both agreed we were grown-ups. I mean I think we had an unspoken agreement, that we were—
Right. Did we?
I think I always implied, you know?
Right. Okay. Do you want to say who?
And if I’ve hurt you, and I’ve got it wrong, I’m so fucking sorry.
Was it Nate?
But I think, from this point on, I want everything to be really open and honest.
Right. Can I send him home?
Sure. Although, what if people ask why he’s being sent home?
Can I at least spit on his cheesecake?
Tom. I just think – I’m not sure. I’m not sure I’m a good fit for a monogamous marriage.
Right?
Yeah?
Okay.
Is that okay? Is that okay to say to you?
Of course. I mean I kind of wish I guess maybe we’d talked about it before our wedding night?
Yeah, maybe that would have been wise.
Hey. Well.
I just think, you know, I needed you, very much, I was not in good shape when we hooked up and I think the business angle, works, we know that. We have a plan on that.
Uh-huh.
But in terms of the relationship. Is there an opportunity for something different from the – whole, box-set death-march? A different shape of relationship? Could that be exciting?
Right? Maybe. I guess.
Right? It’s exciting?
It’s exciting.
We’ve pulled everything else down. But love’s the last one, it’s the last fridge magnet left.
Right. How do you mean?
I mean ‘love’ is about twenty-eight different things – it’s a lumpy sack. And it needs to get emptied out because there’s a lot of ugly products in that Santa sack. Fear and jealousy and control and revenge – and they get such a pretty fucking wrapping in that stocking, it looks so nice, but you open it up—
No. I’m sure. You’re right. You are. Love, it’s – it’s bullshit. But – I do love you.
I love you too.
Hey?
Hey.
What you got on the go there?
Oh. Nothing?
It’s cool. I can just smell it from down there. You know. It’s fine. Smells like – the kind bud.
Uh-huh.
Did you— Did I see you get some shit earlier? You okay?
Oh yeah. Yeah. They paid me up.
For the full shift?
Uh-huh. And a sweetener, it’s actually great because now I can just go home.
Nice. Dude, would it be weird to ask—
Do you wanna?
Um. Sure. But also, I just wondered, for the party, big party and you don’t have a connection for some – powder, do you?
Look, I’m not really the strategist for you. I mean, do you see yourself as a Democrat because—?
Don’t box me in, Nate!
Hey, dude, can I get in?
Um, we’re just talking—
Nevertheless.
Okay?
Yeah. Hey how you doing, man?
Um, good.
Yeah, so I’m really sorry, man. But there’s been a bit of a mix-up with the accommodation.
Oh, right?
Yeah. I’m sorry, but there’s nowhere for you to stay.
Okay, well. I’m sure I’ll figure something out?
Right. But it might be smart for you to leave directly, to find something?
Are you serious?
I’m serious, yeah.
I get the message, it’s fine. Okay? Let’s just keep things cool. I think you need to stay calm. We’re grown-ups, Shiv’s a grown-up.
Uh-huh. And I think you need to go fuck yourself, and if I ever see you in the same room as Shiv again I will pay men to break your legs and if I go to jail, which I won’t, so be it.
Okay. Look, fine, I’m going to head out. I’ll just finish this and—
My mom and dad made a contribution towards the wine so I’d rather you didn’t drink any more. Excuse me.
Are you kidding?
Put it back, Nate. Put my wine back.
Oh come on!
Put it the fuck back.
Waste not want not I guess? Listen. I’ve been thinking. There could be a financial upside to Kendall’s buy-up?
Uh-huh? You gonna pursue the breathable vitamins?
No, funding for my campaign? And you know – side projects.
Such as, what, you have me bumped off, to clean up your history?
No! You’re unmurderable! No, I was thinking, if you agreed to be my putative First Lady, I’d see what theaters are available for the most exciting voice of her generation? That’s you, by the way.
Oh yep!
Hold on— What is this?
Ket. Special K.
Oh no. No, dude. K? I can’t— No I need a different high tonight. I was after some coke?
Oh. Okay?
No?
Well I know a kid. But no. This is ket.
Right but you can get coke?
Yeah, I should think.
Then let’s blow, is that cool?
I don’t know if I can drive, right away?
No? I can drive? I’ll drive. You okay?
I’m fine.
You okay, bud, you gonna be able to find the way?
Oh yeah. Yeah.
Let’s get some air in.
You alright there?
Yeah, just fucking – stick shift.
You used to an automatic?
Uh-huh. Plus I don’t drive that much.
No? Why not?
Because I’m incredibly rich and I get driven everywhere.
You’re incredibly rich?
Yep. I’m loaded beyond your wildest imaginations. How much farther?
Should I kidnap you?
Yeah, if you could fucking walk, you should kidnap me.
I know a house?
Oh you know a house? It’s all coming together. A place to fucking keep me?
Yeah, it’s got a cowshed, it’s only a corrugated-iron roof. So it’s gonna be fucking cold like.
Hey, what do you care?
Exactly. And so what— Are you addicted to coke? Is that why we’re going?
I used to be an addict. But not now.
Not now?
The idea of addiction was a crutch I needed. I needed to feel weak. But now I’m strong. So. I’m free. Which is nice. —
Hey. Kendall? Sandy Furness.
Hey.
How you going?
Fine. Tough.
It will be tough. It will be.
Uh-huh.
But look, I wanted to say, kid, you’ve done the hard part. I’m just off the line with my buddies, and I think this is— I don’t see how he can stop this? Your chunk? We might let Frank in, the coalition is there, kiddo. Get some sleep. It’s going to be fun!
Great.
Great!
Great.
Okay. Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Hello, naughty one? Roman told me.
Right. Yeah, well. You know?
I don’t think any the worse of you.
No?
No.
Well, good.
You know he did always have a favorite, of you children.
Mom? No.
You don’t want to know?
C’mon.
It was always the business. So, I suppose this is just natural. Rory, what about a dance? Are you dancing, Ken?
Hey.
What?
Hey, Con. Good fireworks?
You mean the ones out here or the indoor fireworks, you let off?
Yeah good one. You know. I’m sorry. I am sorry. Hey hey hey? What are you two doing up?
We couldn’t sleep.
We slept this afternoon.
Look at you two!
They wanted to dance?
Well, okay.
You want to dance? Iver?
Hey. You good?
Yeah. Yeah. Pretty good.
Good. Okay.
There’s kinda a weird vibe – with the serving folks. The hobbity people?
Huh?
A caterer, a guy – crashed or got high and nobody knows— Some bad shit went down.
Really?
But the word is the family line is that we’re not going to let it spoil anything?
Right. Oh, good. But he died?
Yeah a kid died, maybe.
Wow.
Yeah. Bad shit. How’s the scrambled egg, has it congealed?
Kendall. Logan wants to have a word with you?
Hey, son.
Hey.
Thanks, Colin. Did you have an acceptable evening?
Uh-huh. You know?
I was up all night organizing my defense.
Right.
Look. So, um. I don’t know if you know, but the caterer I had an issue with, he died last night?
Oh, that’s terrible.
Did you know?
I knew – I knew – I know, since, I just heard. But it’s a shock.
Right. Well. Look. Our guys, one of our guys found a keycard to your room near where this kid went into the water.
Oh? Maybe he – maybe – maybe he—?
Uh-huh. And Amir saw you last night, rather damp. The police officers are here – with Caroline.
We just wanted to check if you had anything stolen last night?
Um – what, as in—?
Did you have anything stolen last night?
I don’t think so?
You might want to check again.
Um—
This kid, I think he might be a thief. Who broke into your room and swiped your card?
Right?
Let me handle this, son.
Right.
I know the guys. They know our guys. They’re all good guys. We can let them know what was taken.
Right … Dad—
Look, this is all quite stressful. Why don’t you get in my car and we’ll drive you to the plane and you can just relax and maybe you should go and straighten out in the desert?
Um – I – I don’t know?
Yeah. I think that would be good.
Um. Right. I mean, nobody did anything wrong and – you know. It sounds like. So?
Tell Sandy you’re out. Tell Stewy. The thing looks like a shit show. Go to the desert. Dry out. You’ve been off-balance.
There’s nothing— I don’t think. I wasn’t there. So?
This could be the defining event of your life. It’d eat everything. A rich kid kills a boy. You’ll never be anything else. Or— Or it could be what it should be. Nothing at all. A sad little detail at a lovely wedding where father and son were reconciled? You’re a good kid. You could still be a good kid.",0.3661841425512518,0.5508907736678209,0.25919048954632934,0.3147948471430157,0.3077995506547658,0.2863291251872267,0.36548926720362424,0.2572910243782514,0.4220005427320887,0.31837455722104224,0.14747570459232,0.08839387489050361,0.16458602489105292,0.4310672135158841,0.3709840789836432,0.16195117269775697,0.23212712702141808,0.19230241072364151,0.11766707771260242
